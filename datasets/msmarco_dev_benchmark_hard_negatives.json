The spin (or lack there of) on a baseball is what makes the ball 'fly' like it does. As the ball cuts through the air, the stitches on the ball create aerodynamic forces of varying amounts on different sides of the ball.",
      "To make a baseball seam bracelet or necklace (the bracelets and necklaces that you see made from the laces of a baseball) you will need a few things: A Baseball. A Razor. Scissors. Bowl of water. Clasps and/or a safety pin. That's all you need to make a baseball seam bracelet or necklace. Now here's the steps to follow when making your baseball seam bracelet or necklace. Note: if you are making a necklace, you may need two some extra string if you want a longer necklace. 1) Cut around one side of the laces of the baseball with the razor blade. Be careful not to cut your fingers off and more importantly, don't cut so close you cut the laces or the holes they go in to. 2) Cut around the other side of the laces and peel what is left away from the baseball",
      "The yarn or string used to wrap the baseball can be up to one mile (1.6 km) in length. Some are wrapped in a plastic-like covering. A significant characteristic of the baseball is the stitching that holds together the covering of the ball. In the early, mid-1800s days of baseball, there was a great variety in the size, shape, weight, and manufacturing of baseballs. Early baseballs were made from a rubber core from old, melted shoes, wrapped in yarn and leather. Fish eyes were also used as cores in some places.",
      "Why does a baseball require so many different layers? In the early years of the game, prior to 1848, baseballs were very bouncy, built with a solid rubber core and only about three inches in diameter. Hitting these lively balls, some pro teams tallied as many as 100 runs per game. You don't necessarily think of a baseball as bouncy. But that's exactly what a ball does when it collides with a bat. Like a bouncing ball, when hit with a bat a baseball deforms for an instant then springs back to its original shape."

      "Save. Jay Paul/Getty Images News/Getty Images. A master's degree takes anywhere from one to three years to complete, depending on the type of degree and the amount of time you can devote to your studies. It's a sizable investment of time and money, but in many professional fields, it's the degree that can open doors. Some universities and programs offer undergraduates what's often called a 4+1, the option of beginning work toward a master's while finishing up a four-year degree, which can take a year off the time required to get the advanced degree. Such programs begin in the second or third year of undergraduate studies.",
      "If you think that a master’s degree is the right choice for you there are numerous options to consider. How long it will take you to complete a master’s degree depends primarily upon which program you want to pursue and whether you want to attend class on a full-or part-time basis. The majority of master’s degrees awarded in 2010 were in just two fields – education and business. If the student already has a baccalaureate degree, these degrees normally can be completed through two years of full-time study.",
      "The average full-time student will earn their Master’s degree in 1.5 to 2 years, but some students take longer due to their schedule restrictions. If you consider the time it takes to earn a Bachelor’s, you will spend between 5 and 7 years in college and graduate school to earn your degree. Considering the fact that a professional with a Master’s degree earns about 20% more in their lifetime than other professionals with a lower level degree. If you are wondering how long it takes to earn your Master’s degree, read this guide and learn what you need to know. Resource: Top 20 Best Value Online MBA Programs.",
      "In the instance of dual degree programs, the length of time to receive a master's degree depends on the additional degree program, and may take as few as four years or as many as ten. Distance Learning: 2 Years. Many schools offer online master's programs, allowing students to work at their own pace without having to travel to campus. Other schools may provide a mixture of distance learning with classroom lab work and/or on-site classes."

It will typically disappear in a few days with frequent feedings and exposure to indirect sunlight at home. Doctors may test the baby 's bilirubin levels during that time to make sure it has not gotten worse.",
      "Jaundice is not an illness in itself, but a medical condition in which too much bilirubin -- a compound produced by the breakdown of hemoglobin from red blood cells -- is circulating in the blood. The excess bilirubin causes the skin, eyes, and mucus membranes in the mouth to turn a yellowish color."

    "documents": [
      "Ovulation is the release of a single, mature egg from a follicle that developed in the ovary. It usually occurs regularly, around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. Once released, the egg is capable of being fertilized for 12 to 48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. This is the most fertile period of your cycle: during ovulation your chances of conception are highest. The time of ovulation within the menstrual cycle is determined by the luteal phase, which is usually 12 to 16 days long. You can calculate the time of ovulation within your cycle by subtracting the length of your luteal phase from the length of your cycle. For example, if your cycle is 28 days long and your luteal phase is 12 days long, the ovulation will occur on day 16 of your cycle (28-12=16)",
      "Tracking Ovulation: A woman’s monthly cycle is measured from the first day of her menstrual period until the first day of her next period. On average, a woman’s cycle normally is between 28-32 days, but some women may have much shorter or much longer cycles. Ovulation can be calculated by starting with the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) or by calculating 12-16 days from the next expected period. The second half of the cycle is called the luteal phase and is from the day of ovulation until the next period begins. The luteal phase has a more precise timeline and usually is only 12-16 days from the day of ovulation. This ultimately means that the day of ovulation will determine how long your cycle is",
      "It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when ovulation happens, unless you're practising fertility awareness (FPA guide to natural family planning). However, ovulation usually happens 10-16 days before the start of a woman's next period. The menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of a woman’s period. This is day one.

    "documents": [
      "Consumer capitalism is a theoretical economic and social political condition in which consumer demand is manipulated, in a deliberate and coordinated way, on a very large scale, through mass-marketing techniques, to the advantage of sellers. The theory is controversial. It suggests manipulation of consumer demand so potent that it has a coercive effect, amounts to a departure from free-market capitalism, and has an adverse effect on society in general. According to one source, the power of such 'manipulation' is not straight forward. Some use the phrase as shorthand for the broader idea that the interests of other non-business entities (governments, religions, the military, educational institutions) are intertwined with corporate business interests, and that those entities also participate in the management of social expectations through mass media.",
      "It is based upon individual selfishness and not communal goals. To conclude, it is evident that global capitalism has developed a panetary consumer culture and that that culture both excludes and exploits. However, consumer culture is not 'based' upon exploitation and exclusion. Instead, it is based upon progress and the continual rise of living standards. It is an unfortunate consequence that this occurs in an exploitative and exclusive way, but it is not an intended goal.",
      "It depends upon a new kind of individualism-projective individualism, where persons use consumer capitalism to project the kind of person who they want to be. Some use the phrase as shorthand for the broader idea that the interests of other non-business entities (governments, religions, the military, educational institutions) are intertwined with corporate business interests, and that those entities also participate in the management of social expectations through mass media.",
      "If consumer capitalism is indeed replaced by a new economic structure, many capitalist bricks may still be needed for any new construction. Whether we choose to attempt new building or just apply a little patching here or there is up to us. What label we pin on any newly emerging economic system is not as important as its ingredients. The problem with our present consumer capitalism is not the name. Critics do not desire an anti-consumer capitalism, just one that does not overemphasize consumption."

      "In order to build the time zone map, they studied Earth’s movements. As the Earth rotates on its axis, it moves about 15 degrees every 60 minutes. After 24 hours, it has completed a full circle rotation of 360 degrees. The scientists used this information to divide the planet into 24 sections or time zones. Each time zone is 15 degrees of longitude wide. If we had one single time zone for Earth, noon would be the middle of the day in some places, but it would be morning, evening and the middle of the night in others. Since different parts of the Earth enter and exit daylight at different times, we need different time zones",
      "The concept of having a time zone comes from a basic desire to always have the local time correspond to the amount of daylight that is available. Most people tend to think of the middle of the day, or high noon, as being the time at which the sun is at the highest point in the sky. Time zones ensure that the sun appears at its zenith in every part of the world. A global map, including time zone divisions. There are 24 different divisions of time zones around",
      "Best Answer: The concept of having a time zone comes from a basic desire to always have the local time correspond to the amount of daylight that is available. In short, most people tend to think of the middle of the day, or high noon, as being the time in which the sun is at the highest point in the sky. The reason there are different time zones and an International dateline is because there are different times. I suppose we could all go on GMT but that would mean that when it is 12:00 GMT it would be the middle of the night in Tokyo and early morning in New York.",
      "Report Abuse. We have time zones so that everyone on the planet does most things at the same time that a person does in another part of the world such as sleeping for example.

      "Definition of Decameron in English: A work by Boccaccio, written between 1348 and 1358, containing a hundred tales supposedly told in ten days by a party of ten young people who had fled from the Black Death in Florence. ",
      "The attention devoted to the tales of the Decameron among English poets of the Romantic period is indicative of a certain fundamental yet complex relationship between the aspirations and the themes of Boccaccio's text and those of the poetry of that revolutionary generation of writers. (It is interesting to note that Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem . The Garden of Boccaccio , a piece specifically about the spirit of Boccaccio and the Decameron, presents a perfect example of the mesh of naturalism and medievalism.",
      "The Decameron (From the Greek: δέκα - ten & μέρα - day) (Italian: Decameron [deˈkaːmeron] or Decamerone [dekameˈroːne]), subtitled Prince Galehaut (Old Italian: Prencipe Galeotto [ˌprentʃipe ɡaleˈɔtto]), is a collection of novellas by the 14th-century Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375). Boccaccio probably conceived the Decameron after the epidemic of 1348, and completed it by 1353. The various tales of love in The Decameron range from the erotic to the tragic. Tales of wit, practical jokes, and life lessons contribute to the mosaic. In addition to its literary value and widespread influence (for example on Chaucer 's The Canterbury Tales), it provides a document of life at the time",
      "Therefore finding a central meaning to Boccaccio's The Decameron depends on understanding Boccaccio's thematic purpose. Boccaccio had witnessed in Florence the plague of the Black Death begun in 1347. Boccaccio's 100 stories are highly structured and may be metaphorically viewed as his gift of order on a disordered world. In these structured stories, Boccaccio celebrates two thematic ideas. The first theme is, as he writes in his dedication, is womanhood and love. The second theme is the intelligence of humankind."

When a planet or moon travels once around an object this is considered a revolution. On Earth, a rotation is pretty short-it happens once a day!

    "documents": [
      "Water pressure is the amount of force from the water main into your home. Water pressure is measured in pounds per square inch (PSI), and normal water pressure is typically between 30 and 80 PSI. Functional flow is the volume of water flowing through your pipes and arriving at individual fixtures. This is a bell-shaped device that reduces the water pressure. Aim for water pressure that is 60-70 PSI. If the house has low pressure, you first want to determine if the house is on a public water supply system or a private well system.",
      "Best Answer: There are a number of factors that come into play regarding actual water pressure in a home system. MOST residential plumbing systems are set up to run at no more than 40 psi.....I have personally tested cpvc plumbing to over 90 pounds with no leaks. Public water supply pressures vary according to the public system, but in our area, they tend to run about 30 psi. If you are on a private well, then your pressure will be determined by how your system is set up. If you have an 'in the well' pump, then you most likely have a bladder tank.",
      "http://www.homerepairtutor.com. Hi Friends, In this quick video I show you how to test your home's water pressure and share how to adjust water pressure down or up at the water pressure regulator. These tips come in handy when your home's water pressure becomes too high or low. You should also test to make sure your water pressure regulator is doing its job and this is the exact procedure to do that. I hope this video helps. ",
      "This water pressure is often well over 100 psi, and too often over 150 psi. However, the maximum recommended pressure for a residence is 80 psi. You can easily test your water pressure with a gauge, such as the one pictured here, that screws on to a hose bibb. These are usually inexpensive (less than $10) at the home center. "

Ground beef that’s been defrosted in the fridge can be safely kept for an additional one to two days in the refrigerator before cooking, says the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

      "The Test. The lactate test is primarily ordered to help determine if someone has lactic acidosis, a level of lactate that is high enough to disrupt a person's acid-base (ph) balance. A high lactate level in the blood means that the disease or condition a person has is causing lactate to accumulate. In general, a greater increase in lactate means a greater severity of the condition. When associated with lack of oxygen, an increase in lactate can indicate that organs are not functioning properly."

      "You won't believe these 10 facts about people. A medium is said to be someone who is able to bridge the physical world and the spiritual world to engage in communication with spirits. These may take the form of the spirits of the deceased, spiritual beings such as angels or nature spirits, or gods of some sort.",
      "Question: What is a medium?. Answer: In both modern and ancient times, a medium is a person who communicates with spirits, usually apart from the use of witchcraft. A medium is, literally, an intermediary between the spirit world and ours.",
      "Best Answer: A medium usually deals in communication between the living and the dead, while a clairvoyant typically deals with knowledge/visions of the living. These are general definitions and there are exceptions I'm sure.",
      "I have already written about what differentiates a medium and a psychic but I want to add emphasis by briefly explaining exactly what a medium does."

      "A peripheral nerve block of the foot is an injection of a small amount of local anesthetic and steroid to block one or more of the nerves that supply feeling to the foot.",
      "Why would a peripheral nerve block of the foot be performed? A peripheral nerve block of the foot may be performed if you are experiencing pain, numbness, and/or tingling in your foot area. This block may be performed in a series of up to five (5) blocks in a row depending on your condition.",
      "A. A. Nerve blocks are used for pain treatment and management. Often a group of nerves, called a plexus or ganglion, that causes pain to a specific organ or body region can be blocked with the injection of medication into a specific area of the body. The injection of this nerve-numbing substance is called a nerve block.",
      "A nerve block relieves pain by interrupting how pain signals are sent to your brain. It is done by injecting a substance, such as alcohol or phenol, into or around a nerve or into the spine. Nerve blocks may be used for several purposes, such as: 1  To determine the source of pain. 2  To treat painful conditions."

      "An axon (from Greek ἄξων axōn, áxōn), axis is a, long slender projection of a nerve, cell or, neuron that typically conducts electrical impulses away from the'neuron s cell. body Some axons can extend up to one meter or more while others extend as little as one millimeter. The longest axons in the human body are those of the sciatic nerve, which run from the base of the spinal cord to the big toe of each foot. The diameter of axons is also variable. Most individual axons are microscopic in diameter (typically about one micrometer (µm) across).",

      "How long is the longest axon in the world? About 15 feet, its the sciatic nerve that runs from the base of the spinal cord to the big toe. Answer     The axons are long so that action potentials can be sent from one part of the body to another very quickly.",
      "1 The DRG is the longest axon in the human body. 2  Humans are mammals. 3  The (confirmed) largest and longest animal to have ever lived is the blue whale. 4  Blue whales are also mammals and thus have nervous systems roughly equivalent to humans. Note that for the sensations in the toes, this means that the axon goes all the way from the toe to the medulla, which is at about the same height as the mouth. This can be more than 2 meters long in tall people. That's a long axon!"
