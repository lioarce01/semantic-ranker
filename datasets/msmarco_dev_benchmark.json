      "A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it. The Valley of Marvels in Babille, Ethiopia. In geology, a valley or dale is a depression that is longer than it is wide. The terms U-shaped and V-shaped are descriptive terms of geography to characterize the form of valleys. A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped. The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice.",
      "Valleys are one of the most common landforms on the Earth and they are formed through erosion or the gradual wearing down of the land by wind and water. In river valleys for example, the river acts as an erosional agent by grinding down the rock or soil and creating a valley. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California. It has a broad plain that now consists of the Merced River along with granite walls that were eroded by glaciers during the last glaciation (photo).",
      "A valley formed by flowing water, or river valley, is usually V-shaped. The exact shape will depend on the characteristics of the stream flowing through it. Rivers with steep gradients, as in mountain ranges, produce steep walls and a bottom. Shallower slopes may produce broader and gentler valleys. A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped. The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice.",
      "A glacier is a large body of ice that formed on land by the compaction and recrystallization of snow, survives year to year, and shows some sign of movement downhill due to gravity. The three main types of valleys are the V-shaped valley, the flat-floored valley, and the U-shaped valley. A V-shaped valley is a narrow valley that has a profile suggesting the form of the letter V, characterized by steeply sloping sides. It results from a stream eroding downward, a process referred to as downcutting.",
      "U shaped Valley-Yosemite. As a glacier moves downhill through a valley, the shape of the valley is transformed. A V-shaped valley is transformed into a U-shaped valley through the glacial erosion processes of plucking and abrasion. This results in large rocky material (glacial till) being carried in the glacier. A material called boulder clay is deposited on the floor of the valley. U-shaped valley in Leh valley, Ladakh, NW Indian Himalaya. The glacier visible at the head of the valley is the last remnants of the formerly much more extensive valley glacier which carved this valley.",
      "This is because they flowed down pre-existing river or V-shaped valleys during the last glaciation and caused the bottom of the V to level out into a U shape as the ice eroded the valley walls, resulting in a wider, deeper valley. For this reason, U-shaped valleys are sometimes referred to as glacial troughs. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California. It has a broad plain that now consists of the Merced River along with granite walls that were eroded by glaciers during the last glaciation (photo).",
      "A valley is a hollow or surface depression of the earth bounded by hills or mountains, a natural trough in the earth's surface, that slopes down to a stream, lake or the ocean, formed by water and/or ice erosion. Systems of valleys extend through plains, hills, and mountains. ",
      "Valleys are one of the most common landforms on the surface of the planet. They are carved by flowing water or flowing ice through the process of erosion, which is the gradual wearing away of Earth surfaces through the action of wind and water. A V-shaped valley is a narrow valley that has a profile suggesting the form of the letter V, characterized by steeply sloping sides. It results from a stream eroding downward, a process referred to as downcutting.",
      "Landforms of the upper valley-V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Landforms in upland regions are dominantly created by erosion processes, where land is worn away. Generally, the volume and discharge of rivers in upland regions tends to be low, and the river uses much of it's energy in overcoming friction. "

Cycles can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults and from 21 to 45 days in young teens. The rise and fall of levels of hormones during the month control the menstrual cycle",
      "For most women, the length of time between ovulation (when an egg is released from the ovary) and their monthly period is between 12 to 16 days (this is called the luteal phase). The first day of your menstrual cycle is the first day of your period (day 1). The period usually then lasts anything from 3 to 7 days. You’ll probably find that if you get any period pains, they’ll be at their worst in the first few days of your period. Your period",
      "The menstrual cycle is an average of 28 days, although it is normal to vary between 23 and 35 days. The cycle is counted from the first day of your period. Ovulation is the release of the egg from the ovary. This usually occurs at about day 14 of the cycle. Once released, the egg is fertile for up to 48 hours. If the egg is not fertilized, then the lining of the uterus will disintegrate, causing a period. By knowing your menstrual cycle, it is possible to approximate when you will be most fertile",
      "Ovulation is the release of a single, mature egg from a follicle that developed in the ovary. It usually occurs regularly, around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. Once released, the egg is capable of being fertilized for 12 to 48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. This is the most fertile period of your cycle: during ovulation your chances of conception are highest. The time of ovulation within the menstrual cycle is determined by the luteal phase, which is usually 12 to 16 days long. You can calculate the time of ovulation within your cycle by subtracting the length of your luteal phase from the length of your cycle. For example, if your cycle is 28 days long and your luteal phase is 12 days long, the ovulation will occur on day 16 of your cycle (28-12=16)",
      "Tracking Ovulation: A woman’s monthly cycle is measured from the first day of her menstrual period until the first day of her next period. On average, a woman’s cycle normally is between 28-32 days, but some women may have much shorter or much longer cycles. Ovulation can be calculated by starting with the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) or by calculating 12-16 days from the next expected period. The second half of the cycle is called the luteal phase and is from the day of ovulation until the next period begins. The luteal phase has a more precise timeline and usually is only 12-16 days from the day of ovulation. This ultimately means that the day of ovulation will determine how long your cycle is",
      "1 Work out the length of your average menstrual cycle. 2  Day one is the first day of the menstrual period and the last day is the day before the next period begins. 3  Ovulation happens about two weeks before the next expected period. 4  So if your average menstrual cycle is 28 days, you ovulate around day 14. 1 Day one is the first day of the menstrual period and the last day is the day before the next period begins. 2  Ovulation happens about two weeks before the next expected period. 3",
      "The day of ovulation differs from woman to woman and can even be different from month to month for an individual woman. For a woman with a 28 day cycle, the window of ovulation is day 11 through day 21 of your cycle. Ovulation could occur on any one day during this window.",
      "It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when ovulation happens, unless you're practising fertility awareness (FPA guide to natural family planning). However, ovulation usually happens 10-16 days before the start of a woman's next period. The menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of a woman’s period. This is day one. Some time after her period she will ovulate, then 10-16 days after this she will have her next period. "

      "For the sake of simplicity let’s call the system consumer capitalism. Doing so does not ignore the fact that from the Progressivism of the early twentieth century through Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal up until the present this consumer capitalism has been modified. What label we pin on any newly emerging economic system is not as important as its ingredients. The problem with our present consumer capitalism is not the name. Critics do not desire an anti-consumer capitalism, just one that does not overemphasize consumption.",
      "Consumer Capitalism will be a critical addition to the growing debate on the consumer as citizen and consumer protection policies. The unfettered marketplace, in which uncertainty rules and the admonition caveat emptor ('let the buyer beware') dictates each consumer decision, has today virtually disappeared. Consumers have become the focus of intensive economic policymaking designed to protect them from the risks and disappointments of the market.",
      "Consumer capitalism is a theoretical economic and social political condition in which consumer demand is manipulated, in a deliberate and coordinated way, on a very large scale, through mass-marketing techniques, to the advantage of sellers. The theory is controversial. It suggests manipulation of consumer demand so potent that it has a coercive effect, amounts to a departure from free-market capitalism, and has an adverse effect on society in general. According to one source, the power of such 'manipulation' is not straight forward. Some use the phrase as shorthand for the broader idea that the interests of other non-business entities (governments, religions, the military, educational institutions) are intertwined with corporate business interests, and that those entities also participate in the management of social expectations through mass media.",
      "It is based upon individual selfishness and not communal goals. To conclude, it is evident that global capitalism has developed a panetary consumer culture and that that culture both excludes and exploits. However, consumer culture is not 'based' upon exploitation and exclusion. Instead, it is based upon progress and the continual rise of living standards. It is an unfortunate consequence that this occurs in an exploitative and exclusive way, but it is not an intended goal.",
      "Capitalism is an economic system in which trade, industry, and the means of production are privately owned and operated via profit and loss calculation (price signals) through the price system. ",
      "The word capitalism is now quite commonly used to describe the social system in which we now live. It is also often assumed that it has existed, if not forever, then for most of human history. In fact, capitalism is a relatively new social system. For a brief historical account of how capitalism came into existence a couple of hundred years ago, see Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto. Class division. Capitalism is the social system which now exists in all countries of the world. Under this system, the means for producing and distributing goods (the land, factories, technology, transport system etc) are owned by a small minority of people. We refer to this group of people as the capitalist class.",
      "consumer girl image by Lev Dolgatshjov from Fotolia.com. Consumer capitalism is a term that has been continually redefined since its introduction into popular culture in the 1920s as the public relations industry became ubiquitous, and used techniques derived from psychology and sociology to mass market consumer goods. For instance, the consumer may think he wants or needs a product, and as long as this desire is maintained, the value of the product will continue to rise. Consumer capitalism functions on the basic economic paradigm of supply and demand, but without regard to a product's intrinsic value.",
      "It depends upon a new kind of individualism-projective individualism, where persons use consumer capitalism to project the kind of person who they want to be. Some use the phrase as shorthand for the broader idea that the interests of other non-business entities (governments, religions, the military, educational institutions) are intertwined with corporate business interests, and that those entities also participate in the management of social expectations through mass media.",
      "If consumer capitalism is indeed replaced by a new economic structure, many capitalist bricks may still be needed for any new construction. Whether we choose to attempt new building or just apply a little patching here or there is up to us. What label we pin on any newly emerging economic system is not as important as its ingredients. The problem with our present consumer capitalism is not the name. Critics do not desire an anti-consumer capitalism, just one that does not overemphasize consumption."

      "Gold is not formed on the Earth like diamonds and many other gems and minerals. Instead, most scientists now believe that gold actually came to earth from outer space in large meteorites that have struck the planet over billions of years. While diamonds can be artificially produced, there is only so much gold available on the planet. It cannot be created in a lab the way that many gemstones can be. While some scientists believe that gold mining in outer space may be the bonanza of the future, such dreams are currently too expensive to be realized.",

On Earth, veins of gold are formed by separation from liquid rock after gravity agglomer … ates the molecules. It will form long chains within spaces in minerals because of its resistance to combining with lighter elements. Gold isn't a rock. It is a chemical element, or, in the eyes of the geologist or miner, it is a mineral. It is … sometimes referred to as a noble metal because it doesn't react easily with other stuff in the earth. That translates into gold appearing as a pure metal in the form or tiny flakes, nuggets or the like.",
      "On Earth, gold is found in ores in rock formed from the Precambrian time onward. It most often occurs as a native metal, typically in a metal solid solution with silver (i.e. as a gold silver alloy). Such alloys usually have a silver content of 8–10%. The oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from −1 to +5, but Au(I) and Au(III) dominate its chemistry. Au(I), referred to as the aurous ion, is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers, thiolates, and tertiary phosphines. Au(I) compounds are typically linear.",
      "The process of erosion had sloughed fragments of gold from the reef into the gully. - Robyn Annear. Ancient Greeks believed that gold was formed by the rays of the sun transforming common metals in the earth. Scientists today still think that gold formation is related to stars, specifically dying stars. At the core of a dying star-a supernova-elements begin to fuse together in the extreme heat. ",
      "Gold is not formed in rock so much as it will tend to concentrate under certain geologic conditions. We see evidence of gold grains in some rivers, and nuggets in some rock formations.

      "Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, and is solid under standard conditions.

      "Answer 1: Gold, in its pure form is not made-it occurs naturally in an elemental form. On a side note, the history of alchemy was largely based on the desire of people (probably kings!) to combine other (cheap and abundant) elements and compounds to make gold.

      "Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Gold was formed in the sense of being placed on the earth when the earth was formed by cooling down from gas ejected by the Sun some 4.5 billion years ago. Gold deposits were laid down as rocks formed as part of that cooling process. The amount of gold in the earth has been constant since then. None has been made on earth, either naturally or by alchemists (who dreamed of turning lead into gold)."

      "Definition. Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP for short, is the energy currency of life. ATP is a high-energy molecule found in every cell. Its job is to store and supply the cell with needed energy. ATP is found in the cytoplasm of the cell.

In this form, energy can be stored at one location, then moved from one part of the cell to another, where it can be released to drive other biochemical reactions. The energy stored in ATP at one location is released from ATP when the terminal phosphate bond is broken. In this process a phosphate group is detached to yield inorganic phosphate and ADP and results in the liberation of 7.3 kcal/mol (under standard conditions)",

Boccaccio's 100 stories are highly structured and may be metaphorically viewed as his gift of order on a disordered world. In these structured stories, Boccaccio celebrates two thematic ideas. The first theme is, as he writes in his dedication, is womanhood and love. The second theme is the intelligence of humankind.",
      "The Decameron (From the Greek: δέκα - ten & μέρα - day) (Italian: Decameron [deˈkaːmeron] or Decamerone [dekameˈroːne]), subtitled Prince Galehaut (Old Italian: Prencipe Galeotto [ˌprentʃipe ɡaleˈɔtto]), is a collection of novellas by the 14th-century Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375). Boccaccio probably conceived the Decameron after the epidemic of 1348, and completed it by 1353. The various tales of love in The Decameron range from the erotic to the tragic. Tales of wit, practical jokes, and life lessons contribute to the mosaic. In addition to its literary value and widespread influence (for example on Chaucer 's The Canterbury Tales), it provides a document of life at the time",
      "Dioneo narrates what is by far the most obscene and bawdy tale in the Decameron. Alibech, a naive young woman, wanders into the desert in an attempt to become closer to God. She happens upon the monk Rustico, and he deflowers her under the pretense of teaching her how to better please God. This tale is originally found in Hitopadesha, a Sanskrit collection of tales. Boccaccio, though, may have directly taken the tale from The Seven Wise Masters, which, although oriental in origin, was widely circulating in Latin at the time the Decameron was written.",
      "By invoking the name Prencipe Galeotto in the alternative title to Decameron, Boccaccio alludes to a sentiment he expresses in the text: his compassion for women deprived of free speech and social liberty, confined to their homes and, at times, lovesick. Boccaccio probably conceived the Decameron after the epidemic of 1348, and completed it by 1353. The various tales of love in The Decameron range from the erotic to the tragic. Tales of wit, practical jokes, and life lessons contribute to the mosaic. In addition to its literary value and widespread influence (for example on Chaucer 's The Canterbury Tales), it provides a document of life at the time",
      "The attention devoted to the tales of the Decameron among English poets of the Romantic period is indicative of a certain fundamental yet complex relationship between the aspirations and the themes of Boccaccio's text and those of the poetry of that revolutionary generation of writers. (It is interesting to note that Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem . The Garden of Boccaccio , a piece specifically about the spirit of Boccaccio and the Decameron, presents a perfect example of the mesh of naturalism and medievalism.",
      "In the last tale of the second day Dioneo begins his pattern of telling the last tale of the day, which he will continue until the end of the Decameron. The moral of the story – that a young woman should not marry an old man – is common in late medieval vernacular literature. This tale is originally found in Hitopadesha, a Sanskrit collection of tales. Boccaccio, though, may have directly taken the tale from The Seven Wise Masters, which, although oriental in origin, was widely circulating in Latin at the time the Decameron was written.",

When a planet or moon travels once around an object this is considered a revolution. On Earth, a rotation is pretty short-it happens once a day! It is the rotation that makes the sun appear to come up in the morning and set at night. On Earth, a revolution is quite a bit longer-one year!",
      "A sphere rotating about an axis. A rotation is a circular movement of an object around a center (or point) of rotation. A three-dimensional object always rotates around an imaginary line called a rotation axis. If the axis passes through the body's center of mass, the body is said to rotate upon itself, or spin. Rotation around any axis can be performed by taking a rotation around the x axis, followed by a rotation around the y axis, and followed by a rotation around the z axis. That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.",

      "A rotation about an external point, e.g. the Earth about the Sun, is called a revolution or orbital revolution, typically when it is produced by gravity. Rotation around any axis can be performed by taking a rotation around the x axis, followed by a rotation around the y axis, and followed by a rotation around the z axis. That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.",
      "Full Definition of ROTATION. 1. a (1) : the action or process of rotating on or as if on an axis or center (2) : the act or an instance of rotating something b: one complete turn: the angular displacement required to return a rotating body or figure to its original orientation. 2. b: crop rotation. 3. ",
      "Rotation notation is usually denoted R(center, degrees).  1  Center  is the 'center of rotation.' This is the point around which you are performing your mathematical rotation.  2  Degrees  stands for how many degrees you should rotate. 3  A positive number usually by convention means counter clockwise. In math, a rotation lives up to its name! To rotate an object you need a center of rotation and how much you want to rotate it. By convention, positive rotations go counter clockwise, and negative rotations go",
      "Earth's rotation is the rotation of the planet Earth around its own axis. The Earth rotates from the west towards east. As viewed from North Star or polestar Polaris, the Earth turns counter-clockwise. The Earth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the sun and once every 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to the stars (see below). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past."

When the brake pads are substituted for new ones, the rotors must be always measured to check if they still have adequate metal left to perform safe braking. 1 On average, the cost may vary depending on location, the mechanic/repair shop and kind of vehicle. 2  Most people pay anywhere from $250 to $375. 3  Each rotor can cost $30 to $55 each, depending on the mechanic.",

MOST residential plumbing systems are set up to run at no more than 40 psi.....I have personally tested cpvc plumbing to over 90 pounds with no leaks. Public water supply pressures vary according to the public system, but in our area, they tend to run about 30 psi.

However, there are many other possible causes of thrombocytopenia, with clinical severity ranging from trivial to life threatening. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion. It can only be diagnosed after all other causes of low platelets are ruled out. When thrombocytopenia is severe (a platelet count less than 20-30,000/microliter), and other obvious causes are ruled out, many doctors administer the first-line treatments for ITP: prednisone, anti-D, IVIG. A rapid response to these therapies supports the diagnosis of ITP.",

      "See: Table Variable Identity Column. It is best to use #TempTable in these cases-then you may Truncate or use DBCC to reseed. You will reap performance improvements with Truncate and be able to create additional indexes. I'd add to the  technically  correct answer of using DELETE @VariableTable that if you happen to also have an Identity-Field in your @Table Variable (e.g. i int (1,1)) and you'd like to re-use this table (even if you re-declare it in a loop) it is still within scope and there it no way to reseed it either.",
      "4. It would be more accurate to say the DELETE is the better option. Nothing to do with table variables you get the same with a #temp table and DELETE. This is quite an edge case in that the 10 rows all fit on one page. TRUNCATE deallocates the last page from the table and DELETE doesn't",

      "Removes all rows from a table or specified partitions of a table, without logging the individual row deletions. TRUNCATE TABLE is similar to the DELETE statement with no WHERE clause; however, TRUNCATE TABLE is faster and uses fewer system and transaction log resources. Applies to: SQL Server (SQL Server 2008 through current version), Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse Public Preview. Less transaction log space is used. The DELETE statement removes rows one at a time and records an entry in the transaction log for each deleted row. TRUNCATE TABLE removes the data by deallocating the data pages used to store the table data and records only the page deallocations in the transaction log.",
      "DML on both table variables and temp tables writes to the tempdb transaction log. Whether or not it is worth switching to TRUNCATE rather than DELETE depends on the size of data involved. TRUNCATE will just log the page deallocations. DELETE will log the actual deleted values.

If you omit schema, then Oracle Database assumes the table is in your own cluster. You can truncate index-organized tables and temporary tables. When you truncate a temporary table, only the rows created during the current session are removed. Oracle Database changes the NEXT storage parameter of table to be the size of the last extent deleted from the segment in the process of truncation. Restrictions on Truncating Tables This statement is subject to the following restrictions: You cannot individually truncate a table that is part of a cluster. You must either truncate the cluster, delete all rows from the table, or drop and re-create the table.",

Metamucil® is the only leading fiber supplement brand with 100% natural psyllium fiber — and that makes all the difference. Psyllium husk, a natural dietary fiber originating from plantago ovata, has been the source of both soluble and insoluble fiber in Metamucil for 80 years. Studies suggest that the psyllium in Metamucil works differently. The psyllium fiber in Metamucil forms a viscous gel that traps some bile acids (made from cholesterol) and gently removes them from your body. This gel also traps some carbohydrates and sugars, allowing them to be more slowly absorbed by the body. ",
      "Psyllium is a form of fiber made from the Plantago ovata plant, specifically from the husks of the plant’s seed. It sometimes goes by the name ispaghula. It’s most commonly known as a laxative. Psyllium provides more benefits to your body than decreasing the amount of time you spend in the bathroom. Numerous studies have shown that fiber like psyllium, as part of a healthy diet, can help lower a person’s risk of heart disease. Psyllium can affect your heart by lowering blood pressure, improving lipid levels, and strengthening heart muscle.",

Psyllium can help relieve both constipation and diarrhea, and is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, hemorrhoids, and other intestinal problems. Psyllium has also been used to help regulate blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Overview. Psyllium is a soluble fiber used primarily as a gentle bulk-forming laxative in products such as Metamucil. It comes from a shrub-like herb called Plantago ovata that grows worldwide but is most common in India. Each plant can produce up to 15,000 tiny, gel-coated seeds, from which psyllium husk is derived",

One fair way is to establish an overall range, typically set at 40 percent. The midpoint represents center, so the high point would be an average of 17 percent more than the midpoint. This is called width of salary. Step 3. Establish the low point. Go back to your midpoint salary range and if you are still using the 40 percent width rule, deduct 17 percent from the midpoint.

Cells of the nervous system, called nerve cells or neurons, are specialized to carry messages through an electrochemical process. The human brain has approximately 100 billion neurons. To learn how neurons carry messages, read about the action potential. ",
      "An axon (from Greek ἄξων axōn, áxōn), axis is a, long slender projection of a nerve, cell or, neuron that typically conducts electrical impulses away from the'neuron s cell. body Some axons can extend up to one meter or more while others extend as little as one millimeter. The longest axons in the human body are those of the sciatic nerve, which run from the base of the spinal cord to the big toe of each foot. The diameter of axons is also variable. Most individual axons are microscopic in diameter (typically about one micrometer (µm) across).",
      "1 The DRG is the longest axon in the human body. 2  Humans are mammals. 3  The (confirmed) largest and longest animal to have ever lived is the blue whale. 4  Blue whales are also mammals and thus have nervous systems roughly equivalent to humans. Note that for the sensations in the toes, this means that the axon goes all the way from the toe to the medulla, which is at about the same height as the mouth. This can be more than 2 meters long in tall people. That's a long axon!",
      "How long is the longest axon in the world? About 15 feet, its the sciatic nerve that runs from the base of the spinal cord to the big toe. Answer     The axons are long so that action potentials can be sent from one part of the body to another very quickly.",

      "The largest blue whales are around 30 m long. This would suggest a DRG axon of at least 25 m, or 75 feet, long. Here's where it gets nuts and things stop making sense to me... Axons typically conduct signals between a wide range of speeds: 0.5 to 100 m/s. 1  The DRG is the longest axon in the human body.
