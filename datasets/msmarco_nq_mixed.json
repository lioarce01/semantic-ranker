      "1 If you are using a meat tenderizer, hold it in your hand and bang on the meat like you would with a hammer and nail. 2  Hit the meat evenly over the whole surface, flip it over, and continue to hit the meat with the mallet. 3  If you are using a knife, make cuts or scores that go across the muscles fibers. Any cut of meat, no matter how inexpensive, can be made tender and delicious with the right techniques. Tenderizing involves breaking down the muscle fibers in the meat to soften the texture, making the meat easier to chew and taste better."

      "The DNA polymerases are enzymes that create DNA molecules by assembling nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. These enzymes are essential to DNA replication and usually work in pairs to create two identical DNA strands from a single original DNA molecule. The 3'-5' exonuclease activity of the enzyme allows the incorrect base pair to be excised (this activity is known as proofreading). Following base excision, the polymerase can re-insert the correct base and replication can continue forwards.",
      "DNA polymerase III (not DNA polymerase) is an enzyme that works in association with other enzymes during the replication of a DNA molecule. DNA replication begins when the enzyme, known as helicase unwinds a DNA strand. Helicase unwinds a DNA strand, thus, in the process, separating the two DNA templates. The result of the unwinding of the DNA molecule is the formation of a replication bubble. Once a DNA molecule is unwound, it is not stable."

In WA the focus has been to alter the pH of the soil, generally by applying calcium in the form of lime sand or limestone. However we believe that the pH of the soil is like a temperature gauge – it tells you the acidic state of the soil, but it doesn’t tell you what is causing the problem.",

In addition, FICO Scores look on your credit report for mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries older than 30 days. If you need a loan, do your rate shopping within a focused period of time, such as 30 days.

      "Hard inquiries stay on credit reports for two years, but the length of time they impact the score depends on the scoring model used. VantageScore takes them into account generally as long as they remain on the consumer's credit file, according to Davies. Multiple inquiries generated when rate-shopping for a mortgage, auto or student loan are consolidated by credit scoring models when done within a certain window of time. The FICO scoring model ignores mortgage, auto and student loan inquiries in the 30 days prior to scoring."

As with between-inning breaks, relievers are supposed to throw their final warm-up pitch with 30 seconds left on the clock. That change wasn't specified in last week's news release announcing the new rules but was included in MLB's written explanation of the changes to all 30 clubs.",
      "(Reuters) - Major League Baseball instituted several rule changes on Friday designed to step up the pace of play amid growing concerns that its games are growing too long. All of the new rules will be enforced through a warning and fine system, MLB said, with discipline resulting for flagrant violators. MLB also announced several changes to its use of the instant replay system, including allowing managers to challenge a call from the dugout rather than by approaching an umpire."

According to the latest research, it may well be that a sigmoidoscopy is the screening test of choice when looking for something as serious as colon cancer in an individual."

Babysitters should be at least 12-13 years old, and can babysit for longer periods as they grow older. Again, this is a very individual decision, and these ages are only general guidelines. You need to decide if your child is mature enough. ",
      "In order to babysit you have to be 10 years old (or older). and have your babysitting license. That's a good guideline, but there's actually no law in Ontario that explici … tly dictates an age and as far as I know there are baby sitting courses available to those who wish to pursue, but there is no babysitting license. If you babysit you should be 14 years old at the youngest but 15 is probably better. That depends on the parents and who they will trust. Fourteen is a pretty good age to start"

      "Each of the fiber systems used in the manufacture of carpet can be divided into two classifications: staple and bulked continuous filament (BCF). Nylon is produced in both staple and BCF yarn. Olefin is typically produced in BCF only. Polyester is manufactured in staple only; cotton and wool are inherently staple. Staple yarns are yarns that are produced in short lengths and spun and twisted together (like cotton) to form long threads of yarn and tufted into carpet. Nylon, for example, may be type 6 or type 6,6 and may be branded or unbranded. These factors influence value, price and performance as well. It is impossible to purchase carpet and anticipate performance or value by fiber ounce weight alone. In essence, two 40-ounce nylon fabrics may differ in price by 30% or more."

      "When to neuter. A male dog can be neutered any time after eight weeks of age. A few years ago, most veterinarians advised waiting until puberty hit at about six months, and some still make that recommendation. Talk to your veterinarian about what’s best for your dog. Neutering sterilizes a male dog so he’s incapable of parenting puppies. Many, many wonderful health and behavioral effects occur because he’s undergone “the big snip.”.

      "Conpoy or dried scallop is a type of dried seafood product made from the adductor muscle of scallops. The smell of conpoy is marine, pungent, and reminiscent of certain salt-cured meats. Its taste is rich in umami due to its high content of various free amino acids, such as glycine, alanine, and glutamic acid. In Hong Kong, conpoy from two types of scallops are common. Conpoy made from kongyiu (江珧) from mainland China is small and milder in taste. Patinopecten yessoensis or sinpui (扇貝), a sea scallop imported from Japan (hotategai, 帆立貝 in Japanese), produces a conpoy that is stronger and richer in taste.",
      "Top 10 unbelievable historical concurrencies. Scallops are edible bivalves similar to oysters and clams. They are found both in bay waters and in the sea. In terms of texture they are somewhat similar to white fish and have a fairly sweet flavor that is ideal for many different dishes. The bay scallop is much smaller than the sea scallop, and the edible muscle is usually about one half-inch (about a centimeter) or smaller in diameter. A sea scallop's muscle can be as large as two inches (about 5 centimeters)",
      "Scallops are a cosmopolitan family of bivalves, found in all of the world's oceans, though never in freshwater. They are one of very few groups of bivalves to be primarily free-living; many species are capable of rapidly swimming short distances and even of migrating some distance across the ocean floor. In a sushi bar, hotategai (帆立貝, 海扇) is the traditional scallop on rice, and while kaibashira (貝柱) may be called scallops, it is actually the adductor muscle of any kind of shellfish, e.g. , mussels, oysters, or clams. Dried scallop is known in Cantonese Chinese cuisine as conpoy (乾瑤柱, 乾貝, 干貝)."

      "If your project list includes a ceiling treatment, you may be wondering whether to install a drop ceiling or a drywall ceiling. There are a number of good reasons DIYers prefer drop ceilings vs. drywall. Let’s look at a few. Installing Drywall Requires More Labor. From start to finish, more physical work goes into a drywall ceiling vs. a drop ceiling. Drywall sheets average about 60 lbs. and hoisting them up to the ceiling requires two sets of sturdy arms or a drywall lift.",
      "Andrew says. Jason, Take a look a Ceiling Link, it’s a PVC based “drop ceiling” system that only costs you about 1″ of space, only twice the space of drywall. A 1000 SQ Ft basement (assuming 20X50) would run you $707 in ceiling link parts, $40 in screws and $700 to 900 in panels (2′ X 4′). Drywall for the basement ceiling, .5 inch. Carpet and padding maybe .75 of an inch. Otherwise there are no framing elements on the ceiling or the floor. Unless you want install a framed sub-floor, but that’s not the normal case for most finished basements.",
      "From standard ceilings to vaulted, popcorn, coffered, or beam, there are plenty of options for ceiling types. The cost to install a ceiling will depend on what type of ceiling you want. Standard, smooth drywall ceilings will have the lowest installation costs. Vaulted ceilings use more materials and are taller, which can bring ceiling installation costs up. Generally, the larger the home or room, the more the cost to install a ceiling will end up being. However, with drywall projects, the inverse is actually true. It costs more per square foot for smaller drywall jobs, like repairs, than larger ones like installation."

Subduction processes in oceanic-oceanic plate convergence also result in the formation of volcanoes.

      "A subduction zone is formed at a convergent plate boundary when one or both of the tectonic plates is composed of oceanic crust. The denser plate, made of oceanic crust, is subducted underneath the less dense plate, which can be either continental or oceanic crust. As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. When two plates move towards one another, they form either a subduction zone or a continental collision. This depends on the nature of the plates involved."

Impairment can be of single or multiple nutrients depending on the abnormality. This may lead to malnutrition and a variety of anaemias. However, generalized malabsorption of multiple dietary nutrients develops when the disease process is extensive, thus disturbing several digestive and absorptive processes, as occurs in coeliac disease with extensive involvement of the small intestine.",
      "Background. Malabsorption is a clinical term that encompasses defects occurring during the digestion and absorption of food nutrients by and infections of the gastrointestinal tract. The digestion or absorption of a single nutrient component may be impaired, as in lactose intolerance due to lactase deficiency. To understand the mechanisms of malabsorption, understanding the normal physiologic process of digestion and absorption by the intestinal tract is necessary. In general, the digestion and absorption of food materials can be divided into 3 major phases: luminal, mucosal, and postabsorptive."

News of singer Rick Astley ’s death spread quickly earlier this week causing concern among fans across the world. However the October 2015 report has now been confirmed as a complete hoax and just the latest in a string of fake celebrity death reports. On Saturday (October 10) the singer's reps officially confirmed that Rick Astley is not dead. “ He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax.",
      "Rickrolling is an Internet meme involving the music video for the 1987 Rick Astley song  Never Gonna Give You Up . The meme is a bait and switch; a person provides a hyperlink which is seemingly relevant to the topic at hand, but actually leads to Astley's video. Rickrolling is said to have begun as a variant of an earlier prank from the imageboard 4chan known as duckrolling, in which a link to somewhere (such as a specific picture or news item) would instead lead to a thread or site containing an edited picture of a duck with wheels.",
      "Richard Paul Astley was born on 6 February 1966 in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, England, the fourth child of his family. His parents divorced when he was five, and Astley was brought up by his father. His musical career started when he was ten, singing in the local church choir. Astley made a comeback in 2007, becoming an Internet phenomenon when his video Never Gonna Give You Up became integral to the Internet meme known as  rickrolling . Astley was voted Best Act Ever by Internet users at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2008."

How do we calculate density altitude? The simplest way is to dial your altimeter to 29.92 and note the indicated altitude, this is your pressure altitude. You can also get a ballpark pressure reading with your altimeter by dialing in your field altitude and taking note of the reading in your pressure window.",

      "In aviation, pressure altitude is the indicated altitude when an altimeter is set to an agreed baseline pressure setting under certain circumstances where the aircraft's altimeter would be unable to give a useful readout of altitude. Aircraft transponders report the pressure altitude; corrections for atmospheric pressure variations are applied on the ground. The relationship between static pressure and pressure altitude is defined in terms of the properties of the International Standard Atmosphere.",

What is the standard temperature for an airport with an elevation of 4000’? The answer is this: 4 ´ 2 = 8 and 15 – 8 = 7, or 7° C. We know that standard pressure—the pressure most likely to be encountered—is 29.92”Hg (inches of mercury) at sea level.

Some protists form structures known as. that are resistant to chemicals and drying and that disperse in the environment. Spores are often the infectious stage of organisms that cause diseases in humans when ingested. Because the Protista are so diverse in form, classification within the kingdom has proved difficult. The classification of the Protista is currently based largely on the structure and organization of the cell, the presence of organelles, and the pattern of reproduction or life cycles.",
      "In all biological taxonomy schemes, protists (/ˈproʊtɨst/) were a large group of diverse eukaryotic microorganisms, mainly unicellular animals and plants, that do not form tissues. Formerly, these were assigned to the now-obsolete kingdom Protista. Protists live in almost any environment that contains liquid water. Many protists, such as algae, are photosynthetic and are vital primary producers in ecosystems, particularly in the ocean as part of the plankton."

      "Velocity is a vector quantity, and average velocity can be defined as the displacement divided by the time. For general cases involving non-constant acceleration, this definition must be applied directly because the straight line average velocity expressions do not work. The units for velocity can be implied from the definition to be meters/second or in general any distance unit over any time unit. You can approach an expression for the instantaneous velocity at any point on the path by taking the limit as the time interval gets smaller and smaller."

The skeletal system performs vital functions — support, movement, protection, blood cell production, calcium storage and endocrine regulation — that enable us to survive. The skeletal system is also susceptible to breaks, strains and fractures. While bones are meant to protect the body’s vital organs, it takes about 10 to 16 pounds of pressure to break an average bone."

The heart pumps the blood and the arteries and veins transport it. Oxygen-rich blood leaves the left side of the heart and enters the biggest artery, called the aorta. The muscular system is made up of tissues that work with the skeletal system to control movement of the body. Some muscles—like the ones in your arms and legs—are voluntary, meaning that you decide when to move them. Other muscles, like the ones in your stomach, heart, intestines and other organs, are involuntary.",
      "The major organs of the body are simply the most well known organs but may not be important if they work alone, as they need to work in co-ordination with all other organs in the body. Starting at the top of the human body, the brain processes information and is the body’s control center. It handles the processes of the central nervous system and cognition. The eyes detect light and convert it into electrical signals which the brain interprets as vision. The chest cavity contains some major organs. The heart’s main function is to use the circulatory system to pump blood through out the body.

    "query": "what kind of mechanical advantage does a simple pulley have",
    "documents": [
      "1 Mechanical advantage is gained by combining a fixed pulley with a movable pulley or another fixed pulley of a different diameter. 2  Movable: A movable pulley has an axle in a movable block. 3  A single movable pulley is supported by two parts of the same rope and has a mechanical advantage of two. Thus, the mechanical advantage is three. By adding a pulley to the fixed block of a gun tackle the direction of the pulling force is reversed though the mechanical advantage remains the same, Diagram 3a. This is an example of the Luff tackle.",
      "A fixed pulley has a mechanical advantage of one, however, it is able to change the direction of force on an object. A movable pulley has a mechanical advantage of two and is connected to the object being moved. A block and tackle pulley provides a mechanical advantage of three and is made up of fixed and movable pulleys. Calculating the mechanical advantage of a pulley: With a pulley, the user pulls one end of the rope and the other end of the rope pulls up on the object you want to move. The force produced by the user of the pulley is called the input force and the force pulling up on the object is called the output force.",
      "This is a fixed pulley and will not add any mechanical advantage, but will only redirect the force applied to the system. If we add another pulley to the load we will then have added mechanical advantage. When calculating the advantage added, you must observe the movable pulleys and their relationship to the load. If the pulley is fixed to the ceiling and the rope passes over it, then the. ideal MA is 1, but there's some friction loss in it. If one end of the rope is fixed to the ceiling and the load hangs from the pulley, then the ideal MA is 2."

      "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited disorder characterized by cancer of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. People with the classic type of familial adenomatous polyposis may begin to develop multiple noncancerous (benign) growths (polyps) in the colon as early as their teenage years. Unless the colon is removed, these polyps will become malignant (cancerous). In people with classic familial adenomatous polyposis, the number of polyps increases with age, and hundreds to thousands of polyps can develop in the colon. Also of particular significance are noncancerous growths called desmoid tumors."

The paper birch is considered by many to be one of the most attractive native forest trees in North America and can be an eye-catching ornamental tree when planted in a suitable location. Easily recognized for its peeling white bark, paper birch bark was used as a paper substitute in the past. Paper birch trees are often associated with the north woods and unspoiled wilderness. Paper birch bark, which can be peeled in large wide strips, was valued by native Indians for its use in the construction of canoes.",
      "Range & Habitat: Paper Birch is an uncommon native tree that is found in northern Illinois (see Distribution Map). It is more common further to the north. Habitats include upland woodlands and savannas (often sandy or rocky), open disturbed woodlands, stabilized sand dunes near Lake Michigan, and riverbanks. Paper Birch and other birches are used by vertebrate animals as a source of food, nesting or den habitat, and cover. The following birds eat the seeds of these trees: Black-Capped Chickadee, White-Winged Crossbill, Slate-Colored Junco, Common Redpoll, Fox Sparrow, Pine Siskin, and Passenger Pigeon (now extinct)."

Follow Business Insider: Your body uses white blood cells to fight off the bacteria and viruses that invade your body and make you sick. In the gif below you can see a white blood cell called a neutrophil chase down a Staphylococcus aureus bacterium. The circular cells that the white blood cell is moving through are red blood cells",
      "Leukocytes (white blood cells) act like independent, single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. Which are a group of immune cells specialized in finding and eating bacteria, viruses, and dead or injured body cells. There are three main types-the granulocyte, the macrophage, and the dendritic cell. Hope this helps.",
      "bacteria enter white blood cells through phagocytosis. As a part of the immune system, white blood cells (leukocytes) ingest foreign matter to destroy it. There are seven diff … erent types of leukocytes, but the primary attackers of bacteria are the macrophages and the neutrophils. White blood cells are blood cells that engulf and digest bacteria  and fungi. Basophil is a white blood cell with granules that stain  with basic dyes."

The precise mechanism whereby streptococcal infections induce psoriasis awaits more research. Since psoriasis may be inherited, those with a family history of psoriasis have an increased chance of developing the guttate form of the disease. Some people carry genes that make them more likely to develop psoriasis.",
      "Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes scaly pink patches. Guttate psoriasis is a particular form of the disease that usually affects children and young adults. It can happen on its own, or as a complication of ordinary (chronic plaque) psoriasis. Often, it follows a bacterial throat infection or tonsillitis."

      "Polyphosphates are salts or esters of polymeric oxyanions formed from tetrahedral PO 4 (phosphate) structural units linked together by sharing oxygen atoms. Polyphosphates can adopt linear or a cyclic ring structures. In biology, the polyphosphate esters ADP and ATP are involved in energy storage. A variety of polyphosphates find application in mineral sequestration in municipal waters, generally being present at 1 to 5 ppm. GTP, CTP, and UTP are also nucleotides important in the protein synthesis, lipid synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, respectively. Cyclic trimetaphosphate. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The structure of tripolyphosphoric acid illustrates the principles which define the structures of polyphosphates. It consists of three tetrahedral PO 4 units linked together by sharing oxygen centres.",
      "To test for polyphosphates in water, the total phosphate and orthophosphate concentrations must be known. The difference between these two values will be the polyphosphate. A minimum of 4 ppm polyphosphate is fed into the water to treat 2 ppm of iron or less. Polyphosphate is used, not to remove iron and hardness from water, but to sequester them so that they do not cause damage to fixtures and outdoor surfaces. This page contains some example of sequestering advice from a number of sources."

In metabolism, your cells use enzymes to precisely control the complicated multi-step chemical reactions that keep you alive. There are two main parts to metabolism: catabolism and anabolism. In catabolism, larger molecules are broken down into smaller molecules, releasing energy.",
      "ATP not only provides energy to your cells, it also allows anabolic processes to occur. Anabolism is the reverse of catabolism, since these reactions build large biomolecules from smaller ones. And the molecules that are produced are the same types as what you find in food, such as carbohydrates and proteins. In a sense, these molecules are like your body's own version of the food it originally came from"

      "With spring severe weather season fast approaching, I thought it would be a good time to review some related material over the coming days and weeks. One thing that forecasters and storm chasers have a love / hate relationship with is the Capping Inversion... Again using the above illustration, lets say that a parcel of air is rising away steadily through the first few thousand feet above ground level, minding its own business when suddenly it slams into the cap at 5,000 feet.",
      "Report Abuse. A capping inversion is usually a situation where a layer of relatively warm air exists over a cooler lower air layer. Recall that an inversion is a layer of warm air above a cooler layer. Since the inversion caps the air, keeping it from rising, it suppresses convection. That said, this can be a good thing. The capping inversion can keep storms from developing early on in the day, allowing the surface to warm and become more unstable, and in some cases allow more moisture to advect in.",
      "An inversion can lead to pollution such as smog being trapped close to the ground, with possible adverse effects on health. An inversion can also suppress convection by acting as a cap. If this cap is broken for any of several reasons, convection of any moisture present can then erupt into violent thunderstorms. Temperature inversion can notoriously result in freezing rain in cold climates. Sometimes the inversion layer is at a high enough altitude that cumulus clouds can condense but can only spread out under the inversion layer. This decreases the amount of sunlight reaching the ground and prevents new thermals from forming."

Hemiballismus can also occur as a result of a traumatic brain injury. There are cases in which victims of assault or other forms of violence have developed hemiballismus. Through these acts of violence, the victim’s brain has been damaged and the hemiballistic movements have developed.",
      "The putamen is also part of the basal ganglia and can be involved in hemiballismus due to the fact that it projects to the premotor cortex through the globus pallidus.

There are cases in which victims of assault or other forms of violence have developed hemiballismus. Through these acts of violence, the victim’s brain has been damaged and the hemiballistic movements have developed.",
      "Hemiballismus, formerly called ballism, is a very rare movement disorder, caused in most cases by a decrease in activity of the subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia, resulting in the appearance of flailing, ballistic, undesired movements of the limbs. It can also appear rarely due to certain metabolic abnormalities. This is another form of tumor that can result in the brain as a result of a tuberculous meningitis infection. This type of tumor can also damage parts of the basal ganglia, sometimes resulting in hemiballismus."

Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. 1 Type 1 DM results from the pancreas' failure to produce enough insulin. 2  This form was previously referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile diabetes. 3  The cause is unknown.",
      "Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes (as it will be in this article) was first identified as a disease associated with sweet urine, and excessive muscle loss in the ancient world. Elevated levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia) lead to spillage of glucose into the urine, hence the term sweet urine. Normally, blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin lowers the blood glucose level.",
      "The term diabetes is the shortened version of the full name diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is derived from the Greek word diabetes meaning siphon-to pass through and the Latin word mellitus meaning honeyed or sweet. This is because in diabetes excess sugar is found in blood as well as the urine. It was known in the 17th century as the “pissing evil”. It was in 1675 that Thomas Willis added the word “'mellitus'” to the word diabetes. This was because of the sweet taste of the urine. This sweet taste had been noticed in urine by the ancient Greeks, Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, and Persians as is evident from their literature.",
      "1 This form was previously referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile diabetes. 2  The cause is unknown. 3  Type 2 DM begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. 4  As the disease progresses a lack of insulin may also develop. 1 Type 1 DM results from the pancreas' failure to produce enough insulin. 2  This form was previously referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile diabetes. 3  The cause is unknown."

      "A primary function of the leaf’s waxy cuticle is to reduce water loss through the leaves, which is particularly important in arid deserts with little rainfall or Mediterranean climates with seasonal rainfall. The cuticle also works with the stomata to help complete photosynthesis. After the stomata open and carbon dioxide enters the leaf, the cuticle protects the mesophyll layer, which contains the photosynthetic cells that receive and process the carbon dioxide to manufacture glucose.",
      "The cuticle is a multi-layer structure composed primarily of cutin, cutan, polysaccharides, lipids and waxes. On the inward-facing side of a leaf, the cuticle attaches to the epidermal plant cell walls, and on the outward-facing side, the cuticle forms a film or skin that covers the leaf surface. The cuticle also works with the stomata to help complete photosynthesis. After the stomata open and carbon dioxide enters the leaf, the cuticle protects the mesophyll layer, which contains the photosynthetic cells that receive and process the carbon dioxide to manufacture glucose."

Forms of limestone pavement can be found in many places in the world, especially in Alpine and Mediterranean areas, but these lack the distinctive surface patterning seen on British pavements. Limestone is a hard sedimentary rock consisting of calcium carbonate, formed by the deposition of plant and animal remains on the sea floor and is thus known as a calcareous rock.

So either you’re not getting these nutrients, which is bad for your general health, or you need to eat a whole bunch of calories in order to get them. The processed foods that contain the most sodium include hotdogs, deli meats, and microwave dinners – all foods you should try to avoid. All of this is a long way of saying that processed food has a lot of bad stuff added to it. And by eating processed foods, we’re putting this bad stuff into our bodies.",
      "The good news is certain processed foods are healthier than some foods found in their natural state, such as: 1  Plain yogurt with added cultures, for example, retains the protein and calcium naturally found in dairy products, and it also includes added good bacteria to help boost our gut function and immune systems. So that means many highly nutritious frozen vegetables, sliced whole grain bread, canned beans, nut butters, and even milk and yogurt are all technically processed foods. We don't eat stalks of wheat, we eat bread, and wheat must be processed to create bread. Even pre-chopped fruit or vegetables are processed. You've probably heard health experts saying to shop the perimeter of a grocery store. That's because the center of the store is where most of the highly processed foods reside",
      "Wonder Bread, with 27 ingredients, half a teaspoon of sugar and 7 percent of your daily allowance of salt in every slice, lasts on the shelf for two weeks. Processed food isn't bad for you because the products -- pasta sauce, macaroni and cheese, white bread -- are inherently sweet and salty. It is bad for you because it is inherently industrial. Freedman's right that just because a food is processed doesn't necessarily mean its bad for you. And just because something is organic or local or homemade or natural doesn't mean its good for you. But I can't help but notice that a Starbucks muffin has 500 calories and that the one I make at home has 140.",
      "Processed foods aren't necessarily unhealthy, but anything that’s been processed may contain added salt, sugar and fat. One advantage of cooking food from scratch at home is that you know exactly what is going into it, including the amount of added salt or sugar. Processed foods aren't just microwave meals and other ready meals. The term 'processed food' applies to any food that has been altered from its natural state in some way, either for safety reasons or convenience. This means you may be eating more processed food than you realise."

However, out of all the estimated reserves, conventional oil is only a small part (approximately 0.5 x 10 12 m 3): the more consistent part (approximately 1.3 x 10 12 m 3) consists of oil with a high viscosity, that is less valuable and more difficult to extract.",

      "In the oil and gas industry today there is a great mixture of both conventional and unconventional drilling. Finding fields that will produce a million barrels of oil per day is hard to find and does not come along very often. For example, in the Eagle Ford Shale, an underlying reservoir to the conventional sands that were being produced is in an area where there is very old production. At first, companies were only pumping small amounts of oil per day.",

Conventional oil is a mixture of mainly pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons recoverable at a well from an underground reservoir and liquid at atmospheric pressure and temperature. Unlike bitumen, conventional oil flows through a well without stimulation and through a pipeline without processing or dilution. Oil Sands. The oil sands are a thick, viscous mixture of bitumen hydrocarbons combined with water, sand, heavy metals and clay. The bitumen is separated from the oil sands through heating processes and is then upgraded into higher valued products for end-use markets.",

Conventional hydrocarbon accumulation is the key to traditional petroleum geology and usually refers to an individual hydrocarbon accumulation in a single trap with a uniform pressure system and oil–water contact. If there is only oil (gas) in the trap, it is called an oil (gas) pool, whereas if there are both oil and gas, it is called a petroleum pool. A conventional hydrocarbon accumulation is a three-dimensional (3D) geological entity with clear boundaries.

Although the terms anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary syndicalism are often used interchangeably, the anarcho-syndicalist label was not widely used until the early 1920s (some credit Sam Mainwaring with coining the term).",
      "Anarcho-syndicalism (also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism) is a theory of anarchism which views revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and, with that control, influence broader society. [a]t the same time that syndicalism exerts this unrelenting pressure on capitalism, it tries to build the new social order within the old. The unions and the 'labour councils' are not merely means of struggle and instruments of social revolution; they are also the very structure around which to build a free society."

Running a campaign to win a presidential primary can range in cost from $50 million US Dollars (USD) to over $100 million USD. By itself, this cost is already enormous, but there’s even more that must be spent to run for president"

The space between the clasts is generally filled with smaller particles and/or a chemical cement that binds the rock together. Conglomerate can have a variety of compositions. As a clastic sedimentary rock it can contain clasts of any rock material or weathering product that is washed downstream or down current. The rounded clasts of conglomerate can be mineral particles such as quartz or they can be sedimentary, metamorphic or igneous rock fragments. The finer-size sand and clay which fill the spaces between the larger clasts is often deposited later on top of the large clasts and then sifts down between them to fill the interstitial spaces. The deposition of a chemical cement then binds the sediment into a rock. Conglomerate has very few commercial uses.",

In some conglomerates, the gravel-size class consist almost entirely of what were clay clasts at the time of deposition. A shale-pebble conglomerate is a conglomerate that is composed largely of clasts of rounded mud chips and pebbles held together by clay minerals and created by erosion within environments such as within a river channel or along a lake margin.",

These are first hydrogenated to give a plant stanol which is then esterified with a mixture of fatty acids also derived from plants.
