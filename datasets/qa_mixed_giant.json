Given the measured temperature (T) and the measured relative humidity (RH), it is possible to calculate the dew point temperature. A fourth parameter is often requested, the dew point temperature. This quantity can be calculated from the three measured parameters. The measured atmospheric pressure is the sum of two terms, the partial pressure of dry air (pa) and the partial pressure of water vapor (pw).",

Lawrence in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society: Td = T - ((100 - RH)/5.). where Td is dew point temperature (in degrees Celsius), T is observed temperature (in degrees Celsius), and RH is relative humidity (in percent).

A technical definition follows: The dew point is the temperature at which the water vapor in a sample of air at constant barometric pressure condenses into liquid water at the same rate at which it evaporates. At temperatures below the dew point, water will leave the air."

Effects of atmospheric instability in moist atmospheres include thunderstorm development, which over warm oceans can lead to tropical cyclogenesis, and turbulence."

When also looking at reasons why the United States decided to enter into war with Iraq was because of the oil and the debate of how much is too much for a barrel of oil. Also that the United States wanted to get Saddam Hussein out of power and charge him with war crimes for killing his own people of Iraq.",
      "The Iran–Iraq War was the first and only conflict in the history of warfare in which both forces used ballistic missiles against each other. The war also saw the only confirmed air-to-air helicopter battles in the history of warfare, with Iraqi Mi-25s flying against Iranian AH-1J SeaCobras on numerous occasions. In 1979–80, Iraq was the beneficiary of an oil boom that saw it take in US$33 billion, which allowed the government to go on a spending spree on both civilian and military projects. On several occasions, Saddam alluded to the Islamic conquest of Iran in promoting his position against Iran."

      "What It Is. An immunoglobulin test measures the level of certain immunoglobulins, or antibodies, in the blood. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight antigens, such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The body makes different immunoglobulins to combat different antigens. 1 Immunoglobulin M (IgM) , which is found mainly in the blood and lymph fluid, is the first antibody to be made by the body to fight a new infection. 2  Immunoglobulin E (IgE) , which is associated mainly with allergic reactions (when the immune system overreacts to environmental antigens such as pollen or pet dander).",
      "In response to specific antigens, immunoglobulins are formed in the bone marrow, spleen, and all lymphoid tissues except the thymus. Classes of immunoglobulins are IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. Also called immune serum globulin. See also antibody, antigen, immunity. IgG is the most abundant of the five classes of immunoglobulins, representing about 80% of serum immunoglobulin protein. It is the major antibody in the secondary humoral response of immunity, serves to activate the complement system, and is frequently involved in opsonization.",
      "An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large, Y-shape protein produced by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the harmful agent, called an antigen, via the variable region. The membrane-bound form of an antibody may be called a surface immunoglobulin (sIg) or a membrane immunoglobulin (mIg). It is part of the B cell receptor (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation."

For an average sized house in a regional area, the cost is usually somewhere between $400 and $500. In metropolitan areas, a complete inspection can be closer to $800 or up to $1000.

In muscle, actin is the major component of thin filaments, which, together with the motor protein myosin (which forms thick filaments), are arranged into actomyosin myofibrils. These fibrils comprise the mechanism of muscle contraction",
      "Lesson Summary. In summary, myosin is a motor protein most notably involved in muscle contraction. Actin is a spherical protein that forms filaments, which are involved in muscle contraction and other important cellular processes. Tropomyosin is a long strand that loops around the actin chains in the thin filament. Troponin is a protein that helps hold tropomyosin in place on the actin filament. For a muscle contraction to occur, troponin and tropomyosin must be moved to reveal the myosin-binding sites. Calcium triggers movement of these proteins. When calcium binds to troponin, the shape of the troponin molecule changes. "

For a 2 inch boneless top sirloin total cooking time of about 18 minutes will give medium rare results. Ideally, you should be using a great instant-read meat thermometer. For medium-rare, cook the steak until the internal temperature is 135 degrees, then remove and allow the top sirloin steak to rest for 5 minutes. Use a good pair of tongs to flip the steak about half way through the cooking time. Once it is done, let it rest on the plate for 5 minutes before you cut into it.",

      "Rye is a cereal grain closely related to wheat and barley. Rye is popular in Eastern Europe with most of the world's crops grown in Russia, Poland, and Germany. Many common food and beverages contain rye, including bread, crackers, beer, and whiskey. Gluten in the wheat flour allows the loaf to rise and become airy, as opposed to the flat, dense texture of 100% rye flour loaves. Rye bread can be made with light or dark rye flours. Light rye flour has a tan or taupe color, light flavor, and contains only a small amount of the rye berry's outer bran shell."

Large amounts of hard to digest food which have been consumed along with liquids may stay in the stomach for 6 to 8 hours. The average is 2 to 4 hours for a small meal with moderate fluid intake. It also  depends on what you use to cook it. If you use a oven perhaps to  cook meat, it might take 10 min, but if you use a stove, it might  take 20 min, but it might be more juicy and tender. So it really  does vary. 2 people found this useful.",

Food then enters your large intestine (colon) for further digestion, absorption of water and, finally, elimination of undigested food. In the 1980s, Mayo Clinic researchers measured digestion time in 21 healthy people. Total transit time, from eating to elimination in stool, averaged 53 hours (although that figure is a little overstated, because the markers used by the researchers passed more slowly through the stomach than actual food)."

Because their natural range consisted of most of the Northern Hemisphere, gray wolves are highly adaptable and live in a wide range of habitats. Spring and fall temperatures range from mild to severe, 30 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit is common. During the spring, the gray wolf's prey is becoming more active, creating a better chance of a meal for the pack. Breeding occurs during spring, anywhere from January to April depending on how far north the wolves are.",

      "The compound is a dinucleotide, because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine base and the other nicotinamide. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two forms, an oxidized and reduced form abbreviated as NAD+ and NADH respectively. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, like all dinucleotide s, consists of two nucleotides joined by a pair of bridging phosphate groups. The nucleotides consist of ribose rings, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with nicotinamide at this position.",
      "Just to clear out some things: As stateted above, NADH is produced in catabolic reactions and is later used in the electron transport chain to obtain energy by converting NADH back to NAD+. NADPH is primarily produced in the oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway.

Some became slaves because they could not pay back the money they had borrowed. The government would also take people into slavery if they could not pay their taxes. There were also many cases of poor people selling their children as slaves to richer neighbours. The demand for slaves in Rome had also grown during this period. As more and more men were now needed for the army in order to extend and maintain the Roman Empire, there were fewer men available to work the fields.",

No-one is sure how many slaves existed in the Roman Empire. Even after Rome has passed it days of greatness, it is thought that 25% of all people in Rome were slaves. A rich man might own as many as 500 slaves and an emperor usually had more than 20,000 at his disposal",
      "Slavery in ancient Rome played an important role in society and the economy. Besides manual labor, slaves performed many domestic services, and might be employed at highly skilled jobs and professions. Teachers, accountants, and physicians were often slaves. Greek slaves in particular might be highly educated. During the Pax Romana of the early Roman Empire (1st–2nd century CE), emphasis was placed on maintaining stability, and the lack of new territorial conquests dried up this supply line of human trafficking. To maintain an enslaved work force, increased legal restrictions on freeing slaves were put into place."

The albacore's fins consist of seven to 9 dorsal finlets, seven or eight anal finlets, and 25-31 gill rakers. It is the only tuna species which may be marketed as white meat tuna in the United States. It is found in the open waters of all tropical and temperate oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea. Albacore is a prized food, and the albacore fishery is economically significant.",
      "If the tuna doesn't spool you on the intial run, you have a reasonably good chance of capturing the fish, moving the boat if you must. (Some large tuna can spool a reel on their initial run. Once I had a tuna spool an International 50 wide with 80 pound test and 23 pounds of drag in about 30 seconds). Tuna are said to consume more food per pound of body weight than any other large pelagic fish in the ocean making them voracious feeders. Interestingly their prey has the smallest prey size/ predator size ratio (some large ocean mammals like whales also feed like that).",
      "Commercial Fishing for albacore tuna off of the Oregon Coast did not begin until 1936 when 40, 000 pounds were landed. The number of albacore tuna caught continued to increase until 1944 when 22 ½ million pounds were landed. Ten years later the landing had fallen to less than ½ million pounds. Since 1954 the number of albacore landed in Oregon had increased but have not approached the number of albacore landed prior to 1944. At this point in their migration an albacore tuna may weigh as much as 40 pounds but normally weigh between 13 to 20 pounds each. Albacore tuna that weigh less than 12 pounds are referred to as peanuts."

      "Essentially, domestic ethane price in the US is less than $4 per mmBtu and we estimate that landed cost of imports would work out to less than $12 per mmBtu. This will substitute propane or naphtha being consumed at a price ranging between $19-23 per mmBtu, said Jal Irani from Edelweiss Securities limited. Shale boom in the US has led ethane prices to plunge by 70 per cent over past four years to less than $4 per mmBtu, Irani added. Given the US' large shale reserves, its oil and gas production over the next decade might rise to exceed Saudi Arabia's production shortly and could reach twice that of Saudi's.",
      "Recall from Part III that ethane has about 66,500 BTU/gallon. If we multiply by 42 to get BTU/Bbl, that yields the BTU factor in the above table. (2,790,000 BTU/Barrel or 2.79). If we divide the price of ethane on a per barrel basis by the BTU factor, we’ll get the price of ethane on an MMBTU basis. (0.46 * 42) / 2.79 = $6.92/MMbtu. Obviously that’s a lot higher than the price of natural gas at $2.00 /MMbtu. But that number pales against natural gasoline"

Spaying is the process of removing a female dog’s uterus and ovaries while neutering is performed on male dogs to remove his testicles. This is one of the biggest advantages of the procedure if you are not interested in allowing your dog to breed. Spaying when performed early reduces the risk of many cancers and the chances of uterine infections that can occur later in life. It avoids mood swings that your dog can show when she is in estrous (heat)."

Administration is usually five percent of the budget, so plan on paying $1,500 for a $30,000 project.

There are cave drawings in France that are over 15,000 years old. Babylonian and Egyptian and Babylonian relief’s depict wrestling bouts where wrestlers are using most of the holds known to the modern-day sport. Wrestling was a big part of ancient Greek literature and legend. Back then wrestling was the number one sport in Greece and also one of the most brutal. The ancient Romans adopted the sport with much enthusiasm but devised rules to eliminate most of the brutality..",
      "First milestones. The first real traces of the development of wrestling date back to the times of the Sumerians, 5000 years ago. The Epic of Gilgamesh written in cuneiform, the sculptures and the low reliefs, are numerous sources that reveal the first refereed competitions, accompanied by music. During the ancient Olympic Games, from 708 B.C., wrestling was the decisive discipline of the Pentathlon. In fact, it was the last discipline to be held – after the discus, the javelin, the long jump and the foot race – and it designated the winner of the Pentathlon, the only crowned athlete of the Games.",

Thus, the mechanical advantage is three. By adding a pulley to the fixed block of a gun tackle the direction of the pulling force is reversed though the mechanical advantage remains the same, Diagram 3a. This is an example of the Luff tackle.",

A movable pulley has a mechanical advantage of two and is connected to the object being moved. A block and tackle pulley provides a mechanical advantage of three and is made up of fixed and movable pulleys. Calculating the mechanical advantage of a pulley: With a pulley, the user pulls one end of the rope and the other end of the rope pulls up on the object you want to move. The force produced by the user of the pulley is called the input force and the force pulling up on the object is called the output force."

People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause. Most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Many people with type I or type IV osteogenesis imperfecta inherit a mutation from a parent who has the disorder."

If one arterial branch is blocked or cut, the collateral channel can often provide the region with an adequate blood supply and thereby, minimizing the damage at tissue level. Arterial anastomoses are abundant in abdominal organs and around joints where active body movements may hinder blood flow through one channel. Arteries that do not anastomose, or have a poorly developed collateral circulation are known as end arteries. These end arteries supply the retina, kidneys, and spleen."

Travell, M.D. In her book, 'Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: Trigger Point Manual', Dr. Travell uses the term dry needling to differentiate between two hypodermic needle techniques when performing trigger point therapy.

Plant Tissues Plant Tissues fall into two large categories: Meristematic, or Permanent (Non-Meristematic) Meristematic Tissues Meristems are places in plants where cell division is occurring. During cell division, one cell becomes two cells. Each new cell can also divide. Lateral meristems come in two basic types: Vascular cambium; meristematic tissue located between the xylem and phloem. The vascular cambium makes new xylem and phloem cells. Cork cambium; meristematic tissue located just below the bark in woody dicot stems. The cork cambium makes new bark cells.",

Therefore, cell division in the meristem is required to provide new cells for expansion and differentiation of tissues and initiation of new organs, providing the basic structure of the plant body. Apical meristems are the completely undifferentiated (indeterminate) meristems in a plant. These differentiate into three kinds of primary meristems. The primary meristems in turn produce the two secondary meristem types. These secondary meristems are also known as lateral meristems because they are involved in lateral growth. At the meristem summit, there is a small group of slowly dividing cells, which is commonly called the central zone",

The costs of set-up are not included in the annual running costs set out below. I outline the costs of setting up a SMSF, and also the annual and one-off costs you can expect from operating a SMSF in my book DIY Super For Dummies, 3rd edition (published in 2015, Wiley).",
      "Sounds good in theory. On average a retail superannuation fund will charge 1.37% of your balance in administration and investment management costs – so if you have a $200,000 in a SMSF, your annual accounts, audit and administration fees are expected to be $2,740 – which is pretty reasonable. However, this theory has a major flaw.",
      "The cost of setting up an SMSF will differ depending on your needs as well as the type of company you use to establish your fund. Setup costs can vary from $1,000 or more than $10,000. Although a super cheap $1000 SMSF setup can seem very attractive, it is important to also consider the upgrade costs or any lock-in period which may apply. Our research a simple fund (without a Corporate Trustee) will cost you between $2,200-$3900. I generally not recommended to set up a SMSF without a Corporate Trustee."

      "A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another. Thus, the neuron mirrors the behavior of the other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in primate species. Mirror neurons are believed to mediate the understanding of other animals' behaviour. For example, a mirror neuron which fires when the monkey rips a piece of paper would also fire when the monkey sees a person rip paper, or hears paper ripping (without visual cues).",
      "Mirror neurons are widely regarded as an important key to social cognition. Despite such wide agreement, there is very little consensus on how or why they are important. The goal of this paper is to clearly explicate the exact role mirror neurons play in social cognition. Monkeys’ mirror neurons are sensitive to goal-directed behavior, and for monkeys miming is not a goal-directed behavior. (It is for humans, because we recognize miming as a kind of communication.) In the miming case, there is no material object to grasp, play with, or eat.",
      "The mind's mirror. A new type of neuron--called a mirror neuron--could help explain how we learn through mimicry and why we empathize with others. The discovery of mirror neurons owes as much to serendipity as to skill. In the 1980s, Rizzolatti and his colleagues had found that some neurons in an area of macaque monkeys' premotor cortex called F5 fired when the monkeys did things like reach for or bite a peanut."

      "This test measures the amount of the protein albumin in your blood. Your liver makes albumin. Albumin carries substances such as hormones, drugs, and enzymes throughout your body. This test can help diagnose, evaluate, and watch kidney and liver conditions. When your kidneys begin to fail, albumin starts to leak into your urine. This causes a low albumin level",
      "The normal range of albumin levels is 3.4- 5.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL). There might be a marginal difference in the ranges in different laboratories. Low albumin levels are indicative of liver disease and further enzyme tests will be required to pinpoint which one it is. Lower levels also show that the kidneys are unable to prevent the albumin from leaking into the blood. Lower than normal levels could be due to the following:-. 1  Excessive burns.",
      "Low albumin levels can suggest liver disease. Liver enzyme tests are requested to help determine which type of liver disease. Low albumin levels can reflect diseases in which the kidneys cannot prevent albumin from leaking from the blood into the urine and being lost. In this case, the amount of albumin (or protein) in the urine also may be measured. Low albumin levels can also be seen in severe inflammation, shock and malnutrition. The level of albumin in the blood drops when the liver is damaged, with a type of kidney disease called nephrotic syndrome, when a person is malnourished, if a person experiences severe inflammation in the body, or with shock. Albumin increases when a person is dehydrated.",
      "Albumin is routinely included in the panels of tests performed as part of a physical, such as a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) , so it is frequently assessed as a part of an evaluation of a person's overall health status. Additionally, since albumin can be low in many different diseases and disorders, it may be used in a variety of settings to help diagnose disease, to monitor changes in health status with treatment or with disease progression, and as a screen that may indicate the need for other kinds of testing."

For example, the allele for Huntington’s disease is dominant, so if an individual inherits an allele for Huntington’s from only one of the parents, they will have the disease. ",
      "For example, if one parent is homozygous dominant (WW) and the other is homozygous recessive (ww), then all their offspring will be heterozygous (Ww) and possess a widow’s peak. If both parents are heterozygous (Ww), there is a 75% chance that any one of their offspring will have a widow’s peak (see figure). Since each parent provides one allele, the possible combinations are: AA, Aa, and aa. Offspring whose genotype is either AA or Aa will have the dominant trait expressed phenotypically, while aa individuals express the recessive trait.",
      "Dominance in genetics is a relationship between alleles of one gene, in which the effect on phenotype of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same locus. The first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive. For genes on an autosome (any chromosome other than a sex chromosome), the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics. Also, an allele may be dominant for a particular aspect of phenotype but not for other aspects influenced by the same gene. Dominance differs from epistasis, a relationship in which an allele of one gene affects the expression of another allele at a different gene."

Exposure to diluted solutions can cause mild and self-limited irritation. Concentrated solutions of quaternary ammonium compounds are corrosive and can cause burns to the skin and the mucous membranes. They can produce systemic toxicity due to their curare-like properties. They can also cause allergic reactions. First, they are known to cause skin and respiratory irritation, and some people are highly allergic to them. Second, some quaternary ammonium compounds, like benzalkonium chloride, are phenolic and have been found to be endocrine disruptors, meaning they interfere with hormone function within the body.",
      "For our purposes, more technically, the specific kind of chlorine compound used in liquid disinfectants is known as sodium hypochlorite, which is found in household bleach. Besides chlorine, another well-known category of disinfectants is known as quaternary ammonium compounds. Keep in mind, that chlorine can work equally well in different types of water hardness. This is not the case for quaternary ammonium compounds, whose capability to disinfect suffers with increasing water hardness. Namely, quaternary ammonium compounds can kill off enveloped viruses much better than non-enveloped viruses. You can liken a non-enveloped virus to one that has a hardy shell, like a nut, around its nucleic acid genome. An enveloped virus is surrounded by a thin membrane, kind of like a thin balloon.",

In older literature this is often called a Menshutkin reaction, however modern chemists usually refer to it simply as quaternization. In di-quaternary ammonium compounds, this process can also result in the formation of fragment ions with higher mass as compared to their precursor ion."

      "Save. The average asphalt road, parking lot or driveway is designed to last for anywhere between 10 and 30 years. However, with the regular application of a seal coating, an asphalt surface can last for decades beyond this. Without sealant, an asphalt surface is likely to crack or deform."

Abdominal angina is defined as the postprandial pain that occurs in individuals with sufficient mesenteric vascular occlusive disease such that blood flow cannot increase enough to meet visceral demands. Schnitzler first described the clinical picture of postprandial pain in 1901. However, the true description of postprandial abdominal angina is attributed to Baccelli or Goodman (1918). In 1957, Mikkelsen proposed surgical treatment of occlusive mesenteric vascular disease.",
      "Abdominal angina symptoms. Abdominal pain is the hallmark of abdominal angina. However, abdominal pain is a non-specific symptom meaning that it can be due to a host of different conditions and does not clearly indicate the underlying cause. Certain characteristics of the pain in abdominal angina may provide a better indication of the condition",
      "Intestinal ischemia occurs when the blood flow through the major arteries that supply blood to your intestines slows or stops. The condition has many potential causes, including a blockage in an artery caused by a blood clot, or a narrowing of an artery due to buildup of deposits, such as cholesterol. Whatever the cause, diminished blood flow within your digestive tract leaves cells without enough oxygen, which causes the cells to weaken and die. If damage is severe enough, infection, gangrene and eventually a hole (perforation) in the wall of the intestines can occur. If untreated, intestinal ischemia can be fatal.",
      "Abdominal angina is abdominal pain after eating that occurs in individuals with ongoing poor blood supply to their small intestines known as chronic mesenteric ischemia. The term angina is used in reference to angina pectoris, a similar symptom due to obstruction of the coronary artery. Pathophysiology [edit]. The pathophysiology is similar to that seen in angina pectoris and intermittent claudication. The most common cause of abdominal angina is atherosclerotic vascular disease, where the occlusive process commonly involves the ostia and the proximal few centimeters of the mesenteric vessels.

In this way, Zaleznik argued, business leaders have much more in common with artists, scientists, and other creative thinkers than they do with managers. Managers prefer to work with people; they avoid solitary activity because it makes them anxious. Several years ago, I directed studies on the psychological aspects of careers. The need to seek out others with whom to work and collaborate seemed to stand out as an important characteristic of managers."

To another person, family may mean a father, grandmother, aunts, uncles, cousins, brothers, and sisters.

But we need all of our brain. Regardless of what we’re doing, even if we’re asleep, all parts of our brain are working.

When almond milk is exposed to room temperature for an extended period of time (like 24 hours) it’ll probably go bad, so you should always remember to store it in the pantry (when it’s unopened), or in the fridge (when it’s opened). You should still check it it’s fine. An opened container of almond milk is usually fine for a week or two, when stored properly. A lot of people state, that it can be fine up to 3 weeks after being opened. You should also be aware of the fact, that almond milk goes bad very quickly when it’s exposed to room temperature.",

As a way of explaining why there is no record of female leprechauns (and therefore no way to procreate in the traditional sense), some sources claim that leprechauns are the unwanted fairies that have been tossed aside by the rest of the community."

The book was first published in Speyer, Germany, in 1487. The Malleus Maleficarum often makes reference to the Bible and Aristotelian thought, and it is heavily influenced by the philosophical tenets of Neo-Platonism. It also mentions astrology and astronomy, which had recently been reintroduced to the West by the ancient works of Pythagoras.",

Its main purpose was to challenge all arguments against the existence of witchcraft and to instruct magistrates on how to identify, interrogate and convict witches. However, the inclusion of the bull certainly gave the impression that the Malleus Maleficarum had been granted approval by Pope Innocent VIII. Some believe that the Letter of Approbation from The Faculty of Theology of the University of Cologne was a falsified document."

      "Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness in the voluntary muscles. PLS belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases. Motor neuron diseases develop when the nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movement degenerate and die, causing weakness in the muscles they control. Onset of PLS usually occurs spontaneously after age 50 and progresses gradually over a number of years, or even decades. The disorder usually begins in the legs, but it may start in the tongue or the hands. Symptoms may include difficulty with balance, weakness and stiffness in the legs, and clumsiness",
      "The PLS files contain information about an audio file's location, but they do not contain the actual audio file or any real audio data. The .pls file extension is also used with the Accounting Plus and AccountEdge software. When the .pls file extension is used for these applications, the files contain financial information such as accounts payable and accounts receivable data. Many of the programs that used the .pls file extension are being discontinued by the distributor of the software. ",
      "In the case that your PLS file doesn't open, it is highly likely that you do not have the correct software application installed on your PC to view or edit PLS file extensions. If your PC opens the PLS file, but it's the wrong application, you'll need to change your Windows registry file association settings. In other words, Windows is associating PLS file extensions with the wrong software program. In seconds, you will learn exactly what type of PLS file you have, the software program associated with your file, the publisher who created it, its security safety status, and a variety of other useful information."

      "Warts are local growths in the skin that are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. There are over 100 types of HPVs. Some HPV types infect the genital and oral mucosa and produce large, unpleasant masses, some of which may become cancerous. ",
      "About Warts. Warts are non-cancerous (benign) skin growths caused by viruses that develop on different parts of the body and can take on various forms. They are contagious and very common: Almost everyone has a wart at some point in their life. Warts can affect people at any age, but are most common among children and young people. Viral warts are a common skin disease, most frequently affecting the hands and feet, caused by the human papilloma virus. While warts are not harmful and usually go away in time without any treatment, they can be unsightly and painful. Warts on the soles of the feet are also called 'plantar warts' or 'verrucas'.",
      "This topic has information about warts on any part of the body except the genitals. For information about warts on the genitals, see the topic Genital Warts. A wart is a skin growth caused by some types of the virus called the human papillomavirus (HPV) . HPV infects the top layer of skin, usually entering the body in an area of broken skin. The virus causes the top layer of skin to grow rapidly, forming a wart. Most warts go away on their own within months or years. Warts are usually painless. But a wart that grows in a spot where you put pressure, such as on a finger or on the bottom of the foot, can be painful. A doctor usually can tell if a skin growth is a wart just by looking at it. Your doctor may take a sample of the wart and look at it under a microscope (a skin biopsy)."

      "Global wind patterns: Winds are named by the direction from which they blow. The globe is encircled by six major wind belts, three in each hemisphere. From pole to equator, they are the polar easterlies, the westerlies, and the trade winds. All six belts move north in the northern summer and south in the northern winter. Trade Winds: South of about 30 degrees the northern or northeast trade winds blow mostly from the northeast toward the equator. These were the sailor's favorite winds, since the weather was warm, and the winds usually blew steadily in an advantageous direction. Columbus used these to sail to the Caribbean.",
      "Also as elevation or altitude increases, air becomes less dense. Unequal heating of the Earth’s surface also forms large global wind patterns. In area near the equator, the sun is almost directly overhead for most of the year. Warm air rises at the equator and moves toward the poles. At the poles, the cooler air sinks and moves back toward the equator. However, it is not this simple. Global winds do not move directly from north to south or south to north because the Earth rotates. Trade Winds – About 30° north and south of the equator, the warm, moist air that rose vertically cools and begins to sink. Here the sky is clear. There are few clouds and little rainfall. Winds are calm.",
      "The doldrums is an area of calm weather. The trade winds coming from the south and the north meet near the equator. These converging trade winds produce general upward winds as they are heated, so there are no steady surface winds. The trade winds are just air movements toward the equator. They are warm, steady breezes that blow almost continuously. The Coriolis Effect makes the trade winds appear to be curving to the west, whether they are traveling to the equator from the south or north."

      "Thyroid peroxidase or thyroperoxidase (TPO) is an enzyme expressed mainly in the thyroid where it is secreted into colloid. Thyroid peroxidase oxidizes iodide ions to form iodine atoms for addition onto tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin for the production of thyroxine (T 4) or triiodothyronine (T 3), the thyroid hormones. In humans, thyroperoxidase is encoded by the TPO gene",

The main difference is that motor neurons move signals from the central nervous system to a central organ or point while sensory neurons move signals from the central organ or … point to the central",
      "Motor neurones also have long axons and transmit nerve impulses from the central nervous system to effectors (muscles and glands) all over the body. Interneurones (also called connector neurones or relay neurones) are usually much smaller cells, with many interconnections. Neurons are similar to other cells in the body because: 1  Neurons are surrounded by a cell membrane. 2  Neurons have a nucleus that contains genes. 3  Neurons contain cytoplasm, mitochondria and other organelles."

      "I have heard for bills, 1 year. For bank statements, I keep them 7 years (because I don't know what to do with them). Although the exception to that is mortgage and car payments. I've heard to keep copies of those canceled checks for the entire time you own the house or car. I've done this for 8 years w/ no problem. Also most bills/cc you can look at at least 6 mths of statements online and even more if you go to paperless. I do keep all of my health papers just in case. It helps."

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that a $1/watt installed photovoltaic solar energy system – equivalent to 5‐6 cents/kWh – would make solar without additional subsidies competitive with the wholesale rate of electricity, nearly everywhere in the US.",
      "This figure is only for a contractor’s solar installation service. For a typical 5,000 watt system this would be $5,000. Money from this figure goes towards an installer’s supply chain costs, labor, overhead, and profit margin. These numbers are, of course, averages. Some installers charge less, some more. As stated in the cost of solar page, the total cost of an installed solar panel system is $3.50 per watt, on average. So installation services are about one third of the total cost for someone who wants to go solar.",
      "Solar Cost Terminology. Cost per Watt: It is common in the industry for companies and consumers to calculate the cost of solar installation by dividing the turnkey cost of installation by the size of the solar photovoltaic (PV) system. For example, a 4 kilowatt system that costs $13,200 would be $3.30/watt. String inverters usually have a 10 year warranty that is extendable to 25 years. The cost to replace the inverter should be considered when calculating the return-on-investment of the solar photovoltaic system."

It occurs when heart (cardiac) muscle becomes stretched out in at least one chamber of the heart, causing the open area of the chamber to become enlarged (dilated). As a result, the heart is unable to pump blood as efficiently as usual. Familial dilated cardiomyopathy has different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved. In 80 to 90 percent of cases, familial dilated cardiomyopathy is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.",
      "In people with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle is stiff and cannot fully relax after each contraction. Impaired muscle relaxation causes blood to back up in the atria and lungs, which reduces the amount of blood in the ventricles. Adults with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy typically first develop shortness of breath, fatigue, and a reduced ability to exercise. Some individuals have an irregular heart beat (arrhythmia) and may also experience a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations) and dizziness."

      "Definition of Transcendentalism. Transcendentalism was an idealistic literary and philosophical movement of the mid-19th century. Beginning in New England in 1836, various visionaries, intellectuals, scholars, and writers would come together regularly to discuss spiritual ideas. In this video, we will explore the main ideas of Transcendentalism, along with some of the key figures of this important American literary movement. The Transcendentalists were radical thinkers. At the time of their meetings, New England was still holding on to a remnant of Puritanical values.",
      "Transcendentalism was a philosophical movement that developed in the late 1820s and 1830s in the eastern region of the United States. The movement was a reaction to, or protest against the general state of intellectualism and spirituality. The doctrine of the Unitarian church as taught at Harvard Divinity School was of particular interest. One of the transcendentalists' core beliefs was in the inherent goodness of both people and nature, in opposition to ideas of man as inherently sinful, or fallen, and nature as something to be conquered. In the 19th century, under the influence of Ralph Waldo Emerson (who had been a Unitarian minister) and other transcendentalists, Unitarianism began its long journey from liberal Protestantism to its present more pluralist form. Transcendentalism also influenced Hinduism.",
      "n. 1. often Transcendentalism A literary and philosophical movement arising in 19th-century New England, associated with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller and asserting the existence of an ideal spiritual reality that transcends empirical and scientific reality and is knowable through intuition. 2. transcendentalism. 1. any philosophy based upon the doctrine that the principles of reality are to be discovered only through the analysis of the processes of thought, as Kantianism. 2. a philosophy emphasizing the intuitive and spiritual above the empirical, as the philosophy of Emerson. Cf.",
      "1 Transcendentalism was a part of this flowering of American literature. 2  Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau were important voices in this philosophical movement that sought to have individuals transcend to a higher spiritual level. "

      "Vaccination against Lyme disease in dogs is only usually suggested by veterinarians for dogs living in Lyme-endemic areas or those who are travelling to such areas. This is due to the fact that the Lyme vaccine is not 100% effective and problems may occur with over-vaccination of dogs. The Lyme disease vaccine for dogs is only thought to be about 60-70% effective, with some dogs going on to develop Lyme disease even after vaccination. This may be due to the rapid rate of hybridization that occurs in the bacteria that cause the disease.",
      "A shield to protect humans against Lyme disease is not at hand, but a vaccine to protect dogs became available last summer. Hundreds of thousands of worried dog owners around the country have already flocked to their veterinarians to obtain it. Spread to dogs, as to humans, by infected deer ticks, Lyme disease may cause fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, painful joints and lameness. Symptoms may not appear for weeks or months, and many infected animals do not become ill.",
      "Lyme vaccine is an immunization that helps prevent Lyme disease from being passed to your dog. Lyme disease is caused by a spirochete bacterial strain called Borrelia burgdorferi that passes to your dog through the bite of certain types of ticks. While Lyme disease can be passed to your dog, Lyme vaccine typically is not recommended unless you live in an area with a high tick population. Treatment for Lyme disease is easy and relatively inexpensive, compared to the complications your dog is exposed to if vaccinated against the disease."

In this way for thyristor circuits used for AC, operation only occurs over one half of the AC waveform.",

Mandarin Chinese is a tonal language, meaning that pitch contours within a word distinguish the word from other words with the same vowels and consonants. Nevertheless, Mandarin also has intonation patterns—patterns of pitch throughout the phrase or sentence—that indicate the nature of the sentence as a whole.",

      "Most hens will start laying between 5-7 months of age. They will lay best at 1 to 2 years of age. All pullets (female chicken under 1 year of age) lay small eggs at first and after a while will lay larger eggs. Younger hens will lay 1 egg every 3-4 days. A hen 30 weeks old can lay 2 eggs every 3 days. Some have been known to lay an egg a day. ",
      "The actual formation of the egg inside the chicken takes about 24 hours, but when they sit down to lay the egg it can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a couple of hours. In each of these parts 3 chickens will lay a third of the number of eggs (so 1 egg). Thus: 3 chickens will lay 1 egg in 1/2 of a day. Then it follows that 3 chickens will lay 2 eggs in 1 day. Now, if we allow those 3 chickens three times as long (3 days), they will produce 6 eggs. 3 chickens will lay 6 eggs in 3 days."

Marx looked at the society that surrounded him,and tried to think why people developed this type of society and not some other one. he thought about the type of society that had preceded it. Before 'modern society' (as he knew it in the 1800s) there was a more rural type of society, before that, there was a 'hunter-gatherer' type of society.

While problem finding in sociology undoubtedly is a result of the growth of theory and method, it also is subject to social determinants within the society (Merton [1949] 1957, pp. ix-xxiv). Sociology, for Durkheim, was the study of “social facts,” and it should not be forgotten that his first major work after completing his French and Latin theses was The Rules of Sociological Method [1895; for a discussion of Durkheim‘s conception of social facts, see the biography of Durkheim]."

Brush your teeth before so that you are rubbing the skin on your clean teeth and not on food remains. If you want to brush your teeth afterwards too, let the banana peel stuff sit on your teeth for a minute or two first. Also, the banana peel is actually good for your teeth because it contains minerals and is not acidic. (Brushing your teeth with strawberry pulp damages the enamel because strawberries are too acidic). Also, there is absolutely no pain or sensitivity involved with a banana. Other at-home whitening remedies which can work is swishing hydrogen peroxide.",

Best Answer: -Brush your teeth as usual with a natural toothpaste or you can use the banana peel first and then brush. -Use a ripe banana as it has the most potassium content in it.

If banana isn't really your thing, you can turn to other natural remedies for whitening your teeth: 1  Use strawberries and baking soda: A paste made from mushed up strawberries and baking soda helps to clear away surface stains and remove plaque. Once the ten minutes are up, take a dry toothbrush and use it to brush the banana paste into your teeth. 1  Brush using gentle circular motions, for between one and three minutes. 2  This will help to get it into all the little nooks and crannies! 3  Then wet your toothbrush and use it to rinse the banana paste from"

    "documents": [
      "[13]. Junior doctors in the US, known as residents, are given a stipend—a form of allowance to offset expenses. The amount of stipend varies by region and by type of hospital, but the average annual stipend for a first year resident in 2011 was $49 000. The amount of monthly stipend given varies between regions, with junior doctors in West Bengal receiving 14 000 rupees (£164) a month and those in Madhya Pradesh receiving just 5000 rupees (£59).",
      "According to the BMA, junior doctors in the UK have taken a 10.9% pay cut since 2000. [6] Salaries have risen but not at the same rate as inflation. This means that while the cost of living is rising, doctors are being paid less. The amount of monthly stipend given varies between regions, with junior doctors in West Bengal receiving 14 000 rupees (£164) a month and those in Madhya Pradesh receiving just 5000 rupees (£59).",
      "The facts on doctors' pay. Basic salary for junior doctors starts at about £23,000 but increases in the second year to about £28,000 (Pay for doctors-NHS Careers). For a doctor in specialist training, the basic salary is between £30,000 and £47,000. Junior doctors get more for working extra and anti-social hours (currently classified as outside 07:00 to 19:00 Monday to Friday) on top of the basic salary, which boosts their income. According to figures from the NHS Employers Organisation, the average total salary for a doctor in training is around £37,000",
      "In 2007, the British Medical Association stated that junior doctors had a lower starting salary than the average for graduates on other courses despite longer training. As of 2008, first year junior doctors were no longer automatically entitled to free accommodation at their hospital. For a doctor in specialist training the basic starting salary is £30,002. If the doctor is contracted to work more than 40 hours and/or to work outside 7am-7pm Monday to Friday, they will receive an additional supplement which will normally be between 20% and 50% of basic salary."

      "Best Answer: Red, black, gray, nude, orange, and lime are all great colours that go with navy really nicely. Technically, on the colour wheel, orange is the complimentary colour for blue. I have this medium length navy blue dress that I will be wearing to a semi-formal dance. I have no clue what color heels I should get. Im also having trouble figuring out what pieces/color of jewelry I should purchase for the dress.",

      "Much like red itself, pinks with red undertones provide natural contrast for the darkness of navy, and they also add a bit of whimsy and femininity to what can otherwise be a rather stern color. My personal preference is to wear shoes in deep, hot or true pink with navy. Darken the color wheel until you had a shade of navy blue on one side, and you'd see those bright yellows and oranges turn to shades like spice, pumpkin, and mustard. Any and all of those yellow-and orange-based shades work wonderfully",
      "When black feels boring and white seems too bright, a navy dress is just right. Navy’s appeal is that it goes with nearly everything but is less harsh -- and also less predictable -- than the little black dress. Pick shoes to highlight your dress or add some unexpected oomph -- a myriad of color options await you."

Iron formations were deposited in many parts of the world during the Early Proterozoic (Precambrian) in formations that are 500 to 2,000 feet or more thick and that extend for hundreds of miles. Therefore, thousands of cubic miles of iron-rich sediments were deposited in a number of basins. Minnesota leads the nation with 70% of the production, while Michigan produces most of the rest (25%). More than 98% of the iron ore that is shipped in the world is used to make steel, while the rest is used in pigments, chemicals, or in other, minor uses.",

The oldest rocks in North America, found in Minnesota, give a U-Pb discordia age of 3.56 billion years (Figure 5). To determine the age of the Solar System and the Earth, we must search for the oldest, least disturbed meteorites.

      "Epidural anesthesia is a regional anesthesia that blocks pain in a particular region of the body. The goal of an epidural is to provide analgesia, or pain relief, rather than anesthesia, which leads to total lack of feeling. Epidurals block the nerve impulses from the lower spinal segments. A small area on your back will be injected with a local anesthetic to numb it. A needle is then inserted into the numbed area surrounding the spinal cord in the lower back. After that, a small tube or catheter is threaded through the needle into the epidural space. The needle is then carefully removed, leaving the catheter in place to provide medication either through periodic injections or by continuous infusion.The catheter is taped to the back to prevent it from slipping out",
      "Using Epidural Anesthesia During Labor: Benefits and Risks. Epidural anesthesia is the most popular method of pain relief during labor. Women request an epidural by name more than any other method of pain relief. More than 50% of women giving birth at hospitals use epidural anesthesia. A small area on your back will be injected with a local anesthetic to numb it. A needle is then inserted into the numbed area surrounding the spinal cord in the lower back. After that, a small tube or catheter is threaded through the needle into the epidural space. The needle is then carefully removed, leaving the catheter in place to provide medication either through periodic injections or by continuous infusion.The catheter is taped to the back to prevent it from slipping out",
      "Topic Overview. Epidural and spinal blocks are types of anesthesia in which a local anesthetic is injected near the spinal cord and nerve roots. It blocks pain from an entire region of the body, such as the belly, the hips, the legs, or the pelvis. Epidural and spinal anesthesia are used mainly for surgery of the lower belly and the legs. Epidural anesthesia is often used in childbirth. But it can also be used to help control pain after major surgery to the belly or chest."

Critical analysis and evaluation refocuses your thinking on your existing knowledge and helps generate new knowledge and ideas",
      "Reflective practice is, in its simplest form, thinking about or reflecting on what you do. It is closely linked to the concept of learning from experience, in that you think about what you did, and what happened, and decide from that what you would do differently next time. Thinking about what has happened is part of being human. However, the difference between casual ‘thinking’ and ‘reflective practice’ is that reflective practice requires a conscious effort to think about events, and develop insights into them. Once you get into the habit of using reflective practice, you will probably find it useful both at work and at ho",

Reflective practice is important way of learning from experiences and improving. Reflective practice identifies areas of practice which are good or successful and areas which are poor. Only when good and poor practice are identified can an accurate assessment of performance be made",
      "Reflective practice is the capacity to reflect on action so as to engage in a process of continuous learning, which, according to the originator of the term, is one of the defining characteristics of professional practice. Reflective practice can be an important tool in practice-based professional learning settings where individuals learning from their own professional experiences, rather than from formal teaching or knowledge transfer, may be the most important source of personal professional development and improvement."

The radiation dose describes the health hazard caused by radiation. The dose unit is Sievert (Sv). Radioactive waste differs from other kinds of waste in that it emits energy in the form of radiation. This energy appears as alpha, beta and gamma radiation. Damage to living tissue can be caused if sufficient quantities of alpha, beta or gamma radiation interact with genetic material within the cells of our bodies."

      "The Facts. A PGA tour caddy can make several arrangements with a player concerning his salary. Most PGA Tour caddies make between $1000 and $1500 per week, but they also make a percentage of what the player wins in the tournaments. This usually equates to 5 percent of any finish outside the top 10. Players breaking into the top 10, but not winning, will share 7 percent of their prize with their caddies. ",
      "In a professional golf tour setting, a player often pays their caddy a percentage of their winnings, which can be as high as 10%. A common pay scale is 5% for making the cut, 7% for a top 10, and 10% for a win. The caddy also usually receives a salary, as the player is not guaranteed to win money at every tournament.",
      "Another 50 golfers made between $1-$2 million, resulting in bonuses of at least $50,000. And if you were the caddie who finished 125th on the money list (the last person to guarantee a PGA Tour card for 2014), you would have received at least $30,508 in bonuses. The average PGA Tour player plays between 20-30 events per year, so it would make sense to assume that the average salary would range from $20,000-$45,000. Bonuses: The real money for caddies comes from bonuses. The PCA President also explained that caddies earn at least 5% what the golfer makes in a given week."

If the blood glucose level rises to 126 mg/dl or above, a person has diabetes.&quot; and &quot;•An A1C 5.6% or below is normal. In prediabetes, A1C levels range between 5.7%-6.4%",
      "A. At present, the diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes is based in an arbitrary cut-off point for a normal blood sugar level. A normal sugar level is currently considered to be less than 100 mg/dL when fasting and less than 140 mg/dL two hours after eating. But in most healthy people, sugar levels are even lower. During the day, blood glucose levels tend to be at their lowest just before meals. For most people without diabetes, blood sugar levels before meals hover around 70 to 80 mg/dL. In some, 60 is normal; in others, 90.",
      "The normal blood glucose level (tested while fasting) for non-diabetics, should be between 3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L (70 to 100 mg/dL). The mean normal blood glucose level in humans is about 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); however, this level fluctuates throughout the day. Glucose levels are usually lowest in the morning, before the first meal of the day (termed the fasting level), and rise after meals for an hour or two by a few millimolar. Blood sugar levels outside the normal range may be an indicator of a medical condition."

      "Polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), E 476, is an emulsifier made in a three-step process from glycerol and fatty acids (usually castor bean derived). PGPR is a yellowish, viscous liquid composed of poly glycerol esters of polycondensed fatty acids from castor oil. It may also be polyglycerol esters of dimerized fatty acids of soybean oil. PGPR is strongly lipophilic, soluble in fats and oils, and insoluble in water and ethyl alcohol. In chocolates, it is used as a viscosity-reducing agent. It is virtually always paired with lecithin or another plastic viscosity-reducing agent"

      "Many people are aware that garlic and curry will cause body odor that can persist for days. But there are other foods that can also cause odor such as: cumin, onions, and paprika, multi-vitamins, coffee and even cinnamon. Cigarettes can cause odor that the smoker is usually unaware of as their nose becomes desensitized to the smell. Constipation can often cause body odor, if you suspect this to be a culprit, increase your fiber intake daily and get some exercise or just take a walk. Foods high in choline, including eggs, beans, chicken, some cheeses, fish and many other foods can give the body an odor that is often called fish odor syndrome.",
      "Thus, you can only reduce garlic smell but cannot remove it completely. Basically, the smell of garlic appears in your breath and even sweat because it contains a sulfur compound (allyl methyl sulfide) that does not break down during the process of digestion. ",
      "Because everyone has a different way to operate their metabolisms, some people do have garlic smell bolder than others after eating garlic. Garlic not only brings many benefits to our health, but also provide us bad body odor. Swallowing gloves of garlic don’t cause bad smell as eating garlic. · Start swallowing 1-2 gloves of garlic a day. It’s good that you eat garlic only for the sake of your health. "

      "Only the costs of raw materials and direct labor are used in the prime cost formula. In the above example, the raw materials are the lumber and hardware used for assembly. The total cost of raw materials is $5,000 + $1,500, or $6,500. The total cost of labor is $15 * 50, or $750. Prime Cost = Raw Materials + Direct Labor. The prime cost of a single bed frame is ($6,500 + $750) / 10, or $72.50. In order to generate a profit, the company must sell each frame for more than $72.50. The company likely also incurred several other expenses that would not be included in the calculation of the prime cost."

      "INR stands for international normalized ratio. The INR provides some information about a person’s blood’s tendency to clot (which is often described as how “thin” or “thick” their blood is). The INR comes from the conversion of another value, the prothrombin time (PT). Prothrombin time is the time it takes for blood to clot in a test tube. A high or low PT can suggest bleeding or clotting tendencies. Most often, the PT is checked to monitor a person’s response to blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin). A normal INR is approximately 1.0. People taking the blood thinner warfarin typically have a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0. People with an INR higher than the normal range who aren’t taking warfarin may have a medical condition that needs further evaluation. A low INR is rarely significant.",
      "The international normalized ratio (INR) is a standardized number that's figured out in the lab. If you take blood thinners, also called anti-clotting drugs or anticoagulants, it's especially important to check your INR. The INR is figured out using the results of the prothrombin time (PT) test, which measures the time it takes for your blood to clot. The INR is an international standard for the PT.",
      "It's safer for you when your INR is in your Normal INR Range because the risks of an INR Level lower than your Normal INR range could mean that you are at risk for potential clots and an INR higher than your Normal INR Range could mean that you are at risk for potential internal bleeding. Normal INR Levels. The normal range for a healthy person not using warfarin is 0.8–1.2. However, this is a dangerously low INR for a person using Warfarin.",
      "However, in people taking warfarin a normal INR level is  … somewhere between 2 and 3.   High levels of INR are associated with: Disorders affecting  clotting factors; Warfarin usage; Vitamin K deficiency; Liver  disease; Disseminated intravascular coagulation etc. People taking anticoagulant drugs, such as Warfarin, will have a raised INR, typically between 2.5 and 3.5. This means the blood is less sticky and less likely to form clots in the event of certain surgical procedures or disease."

      "Techniques !! ! © 2011 Xavant Technology (Pty) Ltd - 1 - Question What is Nerve Mapping and how does it work? Answer Nerve mapping is a technique whereby superficial peripheral nerves can be traced and located transcutaneously for peripheral nerve blocks during regional anesthesia procedures. Answer Due to the fact that the surface location of the nerve is pre-determined and thus the optimal entry point for the needle, the technique reduces the need for multiple needle insertions and discomfort to the patient."

There are two main types, acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and vomiting. The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe. In acute pancreatitis a fever may occur and symptoms typically resolve in a few days. In chronic pancreatitis weight loss, fatty stool, and diarrhea may occur.",
      "Chronic pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas that does not heal or improve—it gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. Chronic pancreatitis, like acute pancreatitis, occurs when digestive enzymes attack the pancreas and nearby tissues, causing episodes of pain. Chronic pancreatitis often develops in people who are between the ages of 30 and 40. The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is many years of heavy alcohol use."

Early weaned calves can achieve adequate rates of growth if given access to a high quality ration. By the time calves are 3 to 4 months of age, they are consuming significant amounts of forage.

It seems at first glance that participating in a salary sacrifice pension scheme is a good deal for workers. However, it is not always the best option. To begin with, a worker must be confident that the lower salary will be enough to sustain his or her monthly budget.",
      "In a Salary Sacrifice Scheme the employer invests the salary sacrificed by the employee, £1,791 pa and also the employer NI savings of £229 pa. The employer's NI is saved because the employer pays a smaller gross salary to the employee, £22,209 instead of £24,000 in this example. As an alternative to the Net Pay Scheme, the employee can opt for a salary sacrifice scheme. Under this arrangement the employee opts to sacrifice part of their gross income for a corresponding pension contribution. This pension contribution is treated as an employer's contribution by the Inland Revenue."

An example of ratio scale data would be the sales of a company, the expenditure of a company, the income of a company, etc. We can do any mathematical procedure with ratio scale data that is not possible with nominal, ordinal, and interval scale data.

However, the life cycle of all mosquitoes is comprised of the egg, larval, pupal and adult stages. Male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar alone, while females extract the blood of hosts in order to develop and nourish eggs. Most mosquitoes lay their eggs directly into water. Others lay their eggs near bodies of water but not within them. Eggs will hatch into larvae within 24 to 48 hours. Larvae soon grow to become approximately 5 mm in length. Most larvae breathe through air tubes. Larger larvae can be seen floating just above the surface of infested waters. ",

Most eggs hatch into larvae within 48 hours; others might withstand subzero winters before hatching. Water is a necessary part of their habitat.

While the normal values of the enzyme may vary from lab to lab, the generally accepted standards read at about 30 to 126 units per liter in adults and about 30 to 300 units per liter in children. ",
      "An alkaline phosphatase level test (ALP test) measures the amount of alkaline phosphatase enzyme in your bloodstream. The test requires a simple blood draw and is often a routine part of other blood tests. Abnormal levels of ALP in your blood most often indicate a problem with your liver and/or bones. However, they may also indicate malnutrition, kidney tumors, or a serious infection. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found in your bloodstream. ALP helps break down proteins in the body and exists in different forms, depending on where it originates. It is mostly produced in your liver, but some is also made in your bones, intestines, and kidneys."

Predictions of a future increase in sea levels are highly variable and range from 0.68m across the Great Barrier Reef Region to a global increase of up to 0.9m by 2100. Changes in sea levels from temperature increases are time-dependent and uncertain, because they are partly linked to the collapse of the Earth’s great ice shelves.

Precise determination of a mean sea level is a difficult problem because of the many factors that affect sea level. Sea level varies quite a lot on several scales of time and distance.",

For example, in a classic bechamel sauce, the cook first prepares a roux by stirring butter and flour together in a pan. This precooks the flour, removing its starchy taste. Most ingredients in the cook's repertoire occasionally need to be thickened. For example, milk might be thickened as part of a sauce, in a custard, or as part of a dessert preparation.

It's important to make the slurry with cold liquid, and then add the slurry to the simmering sauce.

Make a sauce from 1/2 tsp melted butter or olive oil mixed with 1 1/2 tsp flour for every cup of soup. Pour the soup over the mixture and stir constantly until the soup thickens. This method requires at least another quarter of an hour to cook in order to remove the flavour of uncooked flour."

Giant breeds of rabbits may reach maturity a couple of months later so the surgery might be done a little later in these breeds if necessary.

His bloody personality inspired Bram Stoker to write the book 'Dracula'. The book is based on inspirational fantasy and does not relate on true facts. The original Vlad Dracula was not a Count, nor was he a vampire. In writing Dracula, Stoker may also have drawn on Gaelic fairy stories about blood-drinking women. The mannerisms of Dracula are thought to have come from a man called Henry Irving, a stage actor in the Victorian era at a theater where Stoker worked.",

Suggestions for immediate treatment of a corked muscle include: 1  Stop your activity. 2  Rest the injured leg. 3  Use icepacks every two hours, applied for 15 minutes. 4  Bandage the corked muscle firmly with an elasticized bandage. 5  Elevate the injured limb above heart height whenever possible.",

This most commonly occurs due to a collision with another player during contact sports such as football or rugby, or from an impact from a ball in sports such as hockey or cricket. The muscle group at the back of the lower leg is commonly called the calf. The calf comprises of two major muscles one of which originates from above the knee joint (gastrocnemius) the other of which originates from below the knee joint (soleus).

In aerobic conditions, pyruvate is the end-product. Etymology: Gk, glykys + lysis, loosening. a series of enzymatically catalyzed reactions by which glucose and other sugars are broken down to yield lactic acid (anaerobic glycolysis) or pyruvic acid (aerobic glycolysis) . The breakdown releases energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate. Also called Embden-Meyerhof pathway",

Aerobic metabolism is very efficient, producing 34 molecules of ATP from every molecule of glucose, compared to the two ATP molecules anaerobic metabolism generates. Significance. Your body performs aerobic metabolism all day long to provide energy for activities of daily living. Because aerobic metabolism requires water and oxygen, it is the reason that humans breathe constantly and part of the reason why you need to drink water.",
      "Aerobic exercise (also known as cardio) is physical exercise of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process. Aerobic exercise and fitness can be contrasted with anaerobic exercise, of which strength training and short-distance running are the most salient examples. The two types of exercise differ by the duration and intensity of muscular contractions involved, as well as by how energy is generated within the muscle."

These two are the lowest considerable taxonomic levels, but rank above subspecies or breeds or types. However, many used to confuse the two terms, genus and species. Before understanding the difference between the two, it is important to know the meanings of genus and species, and this article follows that.

(2) An individual belonging to a group of organisms (or the entire group itself) having common characteristics and (usually) are capable of mating with one another. Supplement A species is given a two-part name: the generic name and the specific name (or specific epithet). For example, Allium cepa (commonly known as onion) http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary... Genus (general) A class or group with common attributes. (biology) A taxonomic category ranking used in biological classification that is below a family and above a species level, and includes group(s) of species that are structurally similar or phylogenetically related.

      "How Much Spinach. When a recipe calls for cooked fresh spinach, 1 pound of fresh spinach will yield 10-12 cups of torn leaves, which will cook down to about 1 cup. One package (10 ounces) of frozen spinach leaves yields about 1-1/2 cups after cooking. Therefore, you can substitute 1 package (10 ounces) frozen spinach leaves for 1-1/2 pounds of fresh spinach. ",
      "It's my experience that one bag of fresh spinach -- they are typically 10 ounces, not a pound -- when cooked will approximate one 10 oz package of frozen spinach, because the frozen spinach also contains a lot of water, and typically yeilds less than a cup of final product after it's cooked and well-drained. from Answers.com: 4 cups leaves, 6 ounces. 1lb fresh = 1 cup cooked. 15 to 16 oz. can = 1 1/2 - 2 cups. 10 oz bag = 6 cups of leaves, 1 1/4 cups cooked, 2/3 cup cooked & squeezed dry. 10oz frozen = 1 1/2cups cooked.

Asbestos is a metamorphic mineral which was formerly used for insulation. 25 people found this useful.",
      "Metamorphic rocks started out as some other type of rock, but have been substantially changed from their original igneous, sedimentary, or earlier metamorphic form. Metamorphic rocks form when rocks are subjected to high heat, high pressure, hot, mineral-rich fluids or, more commonly, some combination of these factors. Foliation forms when pressure squeezes the flat or elongate minerals within a rock so they become aligned. These rocks develop a platy or sheet-like structure that reflects the direction that pressure was applied in. Slate, schist, and gneiss (pronounced 'nice') are all foliated metamorphic rocks."

These estimates include all associated materials and labor for the wall. If applying a limestone veneer to a cement block wall, the difference in cost is as little as $7 a square foot, however over the surface of an exterior wall, $7 a square foot adds up fast and should not be dismissed lightly."

Chewing your food thoroughly breaks it into smaller pieces, making more of its surface area accessible to digestive juices. Saliva is an integral part of that digestive process, supplying enzymes that dismantle starches and fats."

      "Plinian eruptions are marked by columns of gas and volcanic ash extending high into the stratosphere, the second layer of Earth's atmosphere. The key characteristics are ejection of large amount of pumice and very powerful continuous gas blast eruptions. The amount of magma erupted can be so large that the top of the volcano may collapse, resulting in a caldera. Fine ash can deposit over large areas. Plinian eruptions are often accompanied by loud noises, such as those generated by Krakatoa. The lava is usually rhyolitic and rich in silicates. Basaltic lavas are unusual for Plinian eruptions; the most recent example is the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera on New Zealand 's North Island"

      "If you live in the South and already own solar panels, it could take you just under three years to make up the cost of the $3,000 Tesla Powerwall battery. But if you live in the Pacific Northwest and don't have solar panels, it could take you at least 16 years to make up the cost of buying Tesla's new home battery. There are a lot of variables and some tricky math involved to figure out whether the Tesla Powerwall battery makes sense for you. You can hook it up to solar panels, then recharge it using free energy from the sun. Or -- if your power company charges more for electricity during peak hours -- you can charge up the battery during cheaper hours, then go all-battery when electricity costs are higher. To keep it simple, let's tackle one at a time.",
      "I decided to build a simple, low-cost solar battery that we could use on both camping trips and in case of power failures for some basic lighting, gadget recharging, and other uses. The solar panel supplies the energy, while the battery stores it (obviously), and the charge controller is basically a switch that turns on and off to charge the battery when it’s low, and prevent overcharging when “full”.",
      "Therefore, the upfront cost of the solar panels per watt are Costpanels = $600/75 watts = $8/watt Or, by multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000, Costpanels = $600/75 watts = $8000/kilo-watt. As determined from a survey of current market prices, it costs about $600 to purchase and install a 75 watt panel. So, for example, if you use 10 kilowatt-hours a day, and the cost of power is about 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, then you electrical costs would be about $1 per day (ten times 10 cents), or $30 per month. Also, we need to know how long the sun shines each day on average."

      "Angelman syndrome (/ˈeɪndʒəlmən/ ; abbreviated AS) is a neuro-genetic disorder characterized by severe intellectual and developmental disability, sleep disturbance, seizures, jerky movements (especially hand-flapping), frequent laughter or smiling, and usually a happy demeanor. While Angelman syndrome can be caused by a single mutation in the UBE3A gene, the most common genetic defect leading to Angelman syndrome is an ~4Mb (mega base) maternal deletion in chromosomal region 15q11-13 causing an absence of UBE3A expression in the paternally imprinted brain regions.",
      "In some people who have Angelman syndrome, the loss of a gene called OCA2 is associated with light-colored hair and fair skin. The OCA2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in people with this disorder. Many of the characteristic features of Angelman syndrome result from the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A. People normally inherit one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues.",
      "Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder, most often caused by problems with a gene located on chromosome 15 called the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene. You receive your genes, which occur in pairs, from your parents — one copy from your mother (maternal copy) and the other from your father (paternal copy). Most cases of Angelman syndrome occur when part of the maternal copy is missing or damaged. In a few cases, Angelman syndrome is caused when two paternal copies of the gene are inherited, instead of one from each parent. 1  Symptoms. 2  Risk factors."

A camera's effective megapixel number is the number of pixels on the sensor that are actually used to capture the photographic image.",
      "The foundation of megapixels is the lowly pixel. A pixel is one dot of information in a digital photograph. Digital photos today are made up of millions of tiny dots (Mega = Million). This means that a 10 megapixel image contains approximately 10 million pixels, while an 18 megapixel image contains 18 million pixels.",
      "Digital cameras capture images as pixel elements, known as pixels. Simply put, a megapixel is equal to one million pixels. Digital images are made up of thousands of these tiny, tile-like picture elements. The more pixels, the higher the image resolution. Resolution relates primarily to print size and the amount of detail an image has when viewed on a computer monitor at 100%.",
      "A camera’s megapixel count simply reflects the number of pixels it can capture by the million. For example, a digital camera capable of 3.1 megapixels has a sensor that can capture an image of 2048 pixels wide by 1536 pixels tall, because 2048 times 1536 = 3,145,728 pixels.",

      "For example if the camera utilizes a 4000x3000 pixel image sensor the total number of pixels is 12,000,000 or 12 million pixels. Resolution rates the number of pixels in megapixels (1 megapixel = 1 million pixels), so a camera with a native resolution sensor of 4000x3000 would be a 12MP camera."

In consumer surveys of over 7,000 men, 80% said they noticed a difference. Furthermore, after 12 months of continuous use, 40% showed regrowth. While clinical trials have proven Rogaine can assist in hair regrowth for both men and women, thicken existing hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new hair growth, individual results can be affected by several factors."

      "A tariff code is a product-specific code as documented in the Harmonized System (HS) maintained by the World Customs Organization (WCO). Tariff codes exist for almost every product involved in global commerce. Required on official shipping documents for tax assessment purposes, a tariff code ensures uniformity of product classification world wide. A complete tariff code is no less than six digits and can be up to ten. The more digits in a tariff code string, the more specific the product it identifies. A string of less than six digits is considered a partial tariff code and represents a broad product category or chapter of products in the HS",
      "If the primary method for initiating a harmonized code search fails to result in an applicable match, an alternative search approach is available. Scroll to the bottom of the search results window associated with your commodity query and click the Search the Harmonized Tariff Book Directly link. Harmonized Code Search. Use Harmonized Code Search to identify the proper harmonized code to associate with each commodity included in your shipment. Entering the correct harmonized code allows FedEx to help you determine the necessary customs documentation as well as make a more accurate duty and tax estimate.",
      "The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, also known as the Harmonized System (HS) of tariff nomenclature is an internationally standardized system of names and numbers to classify traded products. Codes have been revised through the years. If it is necessary to refer to a code used in a past trade issue, contracting parties must refer to the definition used at the time of the agreement. These past codes are available on the World Customs Organization website as of May 2014, in their Publications section.",

      "In this case, it is called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. (Steato- means fat.) With NASH, a patient's liver shows some inflammation that in some cases can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis (scarring of the liver tissue). ",
      "By Dr Ananya Mandal, MD. Fatty liver disease is also referred to as Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) or Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). This is a group of conditions where there is accumulation of excess fat deposits over the liver. This fat deposit is also seen among alcoholics",
      "A fatty liver is the result of the excess fat in liver cells. Fatty tissue slowly builds up in the liver when a person’s diet exceeds the amount of fat his or her body can handle. A person has a fatty liver when fat makes up at least 5% of the liver 1. Steatohepatitis means fatty liver with inflammation, in other words, ongoing damage similar to alcoholic liver disease but in this case it occurs in people who do not drink alcohol or drink minimally 13. NASH differs from the simple accumulation of fat in the liver, which is a completely benign condition."

Weeks 13 -20 usually bring the employee up to 75% productivity rate, with the cost being 25% of employee salary. Around the five-month mark, then, companies can expect a new hire to reach full productivity. Training turns out to be one of the costliest investments a company can make. In a report from Training magazine in 2007, companies spent an average of over $1,200 annually per employee. In 2005, employees spent an average of 32 hours per year on training."

      "The name feldspar derives from the German Feldspat, a compound of the words Feld, field, and Spat, a rock that does not contain ore . The change from Spat to-spar was influenced by the English word spar, a synonym for mineral. Feldspathic refers to materials that contain feldspar. Feldspar is a common raw material used in glassmaking, ceramics, and to some extent as a filler and extender in paint, plastics, and rubber. In glassmaking, alumina from feldspar improves product hardness, durability, and resistance to chemical corrosion."

Although this flocculation phenotype has not been fully characterised, it is differentiated from other flocculation phenotypes by a lack of inhibition of the zymolectin-like reaction in the presence of mannose (Dengis and Rouxhet, 1997; Guo et al., 2000; Smart, 2001).",

The floc may then float to the top of the liquid (creaming), settle to the bottom of the liquid (sedimentation), or be readily filtered from the liquid. Flocculation (in polymer science) : When a sol is colloidally unstable (I.e., the rate of aggregation is not negligible) then the formation of aggregates is called floculation or coagulation.

      "Flocculation. Flocculation, in the field of chemistry, is a process wherein colloids come out of suspension in the form of floc or flake; either spontaneously or due to the addition of a clarifying agent. The action differs from precipitation in that, prior to flocculation, colloids are merely suspended in a liquid and not actually dissolved in a solution. In the flocculated system, there is no formation of a cake, since all the flocs are in the suspension."

      "The bones of fetal kittens become mineralized at around day 40-45 of gestation. If radiographs taken of the pregnant cat reveal the skeletons of the kittens, then we can say that the fetal age of those kittens is at least 40-45 days or more."

Over the next few months the illness spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Through July 2003, a total of 192 SARS cases had been reported in the United States, including 159 suspect and 33 probable cases; of the 33 probable cases only 8 had laboratory evidence of the SARS virus.",

The incubation period (the time between exposure to the SARS virus and onset of symptoms) is typically two to seven days, although in some cases it may be as long as 10 days. Information suggests that people with SARS are most likely to be infectious only when they have symptoms such as fever or cough.

The incubation period for SARS is typically 2 to 7 days, although in some cases it may be as long as 10 days. In a very small proportion of cases, incubation periods of up to 14 days have been reported. Droplet spread can happen when droplets from the cough or sneeze of an infected person are propelled a short distance (generally up to 3 feet) through the air and deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby.",
      "On April 16, 2003, following the outbreak of SARS in Asia and secondary cases elsewhere in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a press release stating that the coronavirus identified by a number of laboratories was the official cause of SARS. In severe cases, it develops into respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and in 70-90% of the cases, they develop lymphopenia (low count of lymphocyte white blood cells). The incubation period for SARS-CoV is from 2–10 days, sometimes lasting up to 13 days, with a mean of 5 days. So symptoms usually develop between 2–10 days following infection by the virus. As part of the immune response, IgM antibody to the SARS-CoV is produced"

      "Thermi-Gen™ is a non-surgical procedure that uses Radiofrequency (RF) energy to stimulate collagen for tightening and smoothing the skin of the face and neck. This procedure provides tighter, smoother, more youthful looking skin for all skin types (safe for light and dark complexions). Thermi-Gen™ technology is more effective because it has an internal probe that enables the doctor to apply the treating energy BELOW the skin surface – directly to the targeted collagen layer. Another unique feature of Thermi-Gen™ is its continuous temperature monitor located on the internal probe."

      "Becoming worried about how long does implantation cramping very last is but evident for pregnant women struggling from implantation cramps. Basically, implantation cramping takes place about 8-ten days following ovulation when the fertilized egg attaches alone to the lining of the uterus wall. It is regarded as as one of the very first indicators of pregnancy. Some pregnant women could complain of discomfort on 1 side of the uterus, based on the location of the uterus the egg implants. A lot more often than not, the soreness occurs for a day or two. In specific circumstances, implantation cramping can very last for up to a week.",
      "when i was pregnant with my son, i had implantation bleeding, and cramps a little before i was supposed to getmy period and mistook this for my period coming. I didn't think I was pregnant until about 6 weeks and had horrible cramping that landed me in the er, where i learned that i was just dehydrated. ",
      "See if you're having cramps. Pregnancy bleeding from implantation may include some mild cramping as the egg implants and the uterus is changing to accommodate the embryo. However, cramping with implantation bleeding is usually much lighter than what women might experience with a regular period. This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex. If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding.",
      "The normal time frame for implantation to occur after fertilization is approximately 9 to 12 days. The period of implantation may vary in a few cases. Some women may experience cramping earlier than the mentioned time, whereas some may experience it at a later date. The duration is normally brief. "

      "By this method we discovered that Giardia lamblia has a ribosomal-RNA sequence that is very close to that of prokaryotic cells. This Giardia ribosomal RNA shares more of its sequence with prokaryotes than does the corresponding RNA of any other eukaryote. Thus Giardia is evolutionarily closer to the prokaryotes than other eukaryotes are, and we can take this to mean that Giardia is a member of the earliest emerging eukaryotic lineage. Valuable Lessons. Having established that Giardia occupies an important position in the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, we have been interested in exploring aspects of its life history to see what we can learn about the early eukaryotes."

Enzymatic breakdown of carbohydrates pauses in your stomach and resumes in your small bowel. Pancreatic amylase continues the digestion of complex sugars and starches. Enzymes in the wall of your small intestine complete the final digestive step by breaking two-sugar carbohydrates, or disaccharides, into single sugar molecules, or monosaccharides. There they encounter other proteases that further digest them into their component amino acids. Free amino acids pass through the lining of your small intestine and enter your bloodstream, which transports them to your body tissues. Amino acids are used to form new proteins and fuel energy production.",

These rocks can be found on the floor of the playa with long trails behind them. Somehow these rocks slide across the playa, cutting a furrow in the sediment as they move. The shape of trails behind the rocks suggest that they move during times when the floor of Racetrack Playa is covered with a very soft mud. A lack of disturbed mud around the rock trails eliminates the possibility of a human or animal pushing or assisting the motion of the rocks. This was once the favorite explanation."

      "By Michael Biamonte, C.C.N. Candida Albicans is a yeast that lives in our intestinal tract. It is also the yeast that causes vaginal yeast infections. It is normal to have small amounts of candida so the friendly and protective bacteria in our body called “Acidophillus and Bifidus” can use it as food. When something happens to kill off these friendly bacteria the candida cells begin to multiply out of control.",
      "When the growth of yeast is NOT kept in check by the good probiotic bacteria and the yeast becomes too widespread, the body identifies it as a foreign invader and an immune response is triggered. The immune response can cause fatigue, weakness, feelings of malaise or depression, and flu-like symptoms."

    "documents": [
      "The control of cerebral blood flow is complex, and only beginning to be elucidated. Studies have identified three key regulatory paradigms. The first is cerebral pressure autoregulation, which maintains a constant flow in the face of changing cerebral perfusion pressure. Flow-metabolism coupling refers to the brains ability to vary blood flow to match metabolic activity. The process whereby the cerebral arteries (specifically arterioles) maintain a constant blood flow (CBF) in the face of changing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is referred to as cerebral pressure autoregulation.",
      "Autoregulation is a process within many biological systems, resulting from an internal adaptive mechanism that works to adjust (or mitigate) that system's response to stimuli. While most systems of the body show some degree of autoregulation, it is most clearly observed in the kidney, the heart, and the brain. Homeometric autoregulation, in the context of the circulatory system, is the heart's ability to increase contractility and restore stroke volume when afterload increases. This is in contrast to heterometric regulation.",
      "Cerebral autoregulation is a process in mammals, which aims to maintain adequate and stable cerebral blood flow. While most systems of the body show some degree of autoregulation, the brain is very sensitive to over-and underperfusion. Cerebral autoregulation plays an important role in maintaining an appropriate blood flow to that region. Brain perfusion is essential for life since the brain has a high metabolic demand"

The reason you’ll note on non-researched websites (there are hundreds!), that pineapple and most other fruits are alkaline, is due to their citric acid content. Remember the lemon, very high in citric acid…yet alkaline-forming in the body. ",
      "Best Answer: Pineapple juice is acidic with your pH noted being in the right ballpark. While pineapple juice is acidic, pineapple is a alkali forming (aka alkalyzing) food, a food that creates a more alkaline environment in the stomach. As noted in one of my sources ... Although it might seem that citrus fruits would have an acidifying effect on the body, the citric acid they contain actually has an alkalinizing effect in the system. Note that a food's acid or alkaline forming tendency in the body has nothing to do with the actual pH of the food itself. For example, lemons are very acidic, however the end products they produce after digestion and assimilation are very alkaline so, lemons are alkaline forming in the body",
      "To maintain health, the diet should consist of 60% alkaline forming foods and 40% acid forming foods. To restore health, the diet should consist of 80% alkaline forming foods and 20% acid forming foods. Generally, alkaline forming foods include: most fruits, green vegetables, peas, beans, lentils, spices, herbs and seasonings, and seeds and nuts. Generally, acid forming foods include: meat, fish, poultry, eggs, grains, and legumes."

There should be a cabinet or shelf above the spot where the microwave will be installed so that you can fasten the top of the microwave to it. Most OTR microwaves are just under 30 in. wide; heights vary from about 10 to 18 inches and depths vary from 12 to about 18 inches. You can try using a stud finder (I've never had much luck with them), or look for fasteners inside the wall cabinets and measure in 16-inch increments over toward the wall where the microwave will be mounted. Wall studs are usually spaced 16 inches on-center, so you should be able to project the stud positions.",

With material costs accounting for about a third of overall roof replacement costs, a typical clay tile roof can cost as much as $45,000.

      "But your location also plays a factor. Just like real estate is more expensive in certain parts of the country, so too does the cost of roof repair vary by location. People in New York (one of the more expensive regions) can expect to pay $12,000 - $14,000, on average, for a complete roof replacement job. People in the Midwest might pay $7,000 for a new roof. So location has a lot to do with it. According to Remodeling magazine's 2008 Cost vs. Value Report, homeowners in the United States pay $18,825 on average to replace a roof. This number is based on the use of asphalt shingles. According to the Fine Living website, the national average cost to replace a roof is $11,399. We visited more than 45 websites while researching this article (you're welcome!), and while the cost estimates varied greatly from one site to another, the 11K number does seem to be realistic."

Heated pools allow for a longer swimming season than non-heated pools, but they have a higher cost of ownership. In addition to the fuel needed to run a swimming pool heater (at least if it’s electric or gas; free-energy solar heaters are also available), mechanical upkeep is also required.",
      "What is the payback of a solar pool? If you are currently using a gas or electric pool heater, the savings from solar pool heating system will pay for itself in 2-3 years of installation. For example, the average system costs about $5,500 and it typically costs about $2,000 a year to heat a pool with gas. The payback period would be only 2.75 years in this particular instance. A solar pool heater can be installed for $3,500 to $8,000. Since the sun is free, it will cost you nothing to heat your pool from April through November. Plus, there are no regular maintenance fees. After five years, you probably won’t spend any additional money than what you originally did for"

Bowler Brad Angelo, in a 2003 article for The Los Angeles Times, said he started bowling at an early age and bowls because he loves it as opposed to making money. The first bowler to earn a million dollars was Earl Anthony, a six-time PBA player of the year, according to an article by Steve Kallas for Sports Plus. Top bowlers such as Walter Ray have earned more than $4 million since joining the tour in 1980.",

As in ramjets, scramjets also compress the incoming air before combustion using the speed of the vehicle. However, ramjets decelerate the airflow to subsonic speeds within the engine prior to combustion, though airflow in a scramjet is supersonic throughout the entire engine. Ramjet and Scramjets are engines using its own speed to compress air and propel the engine. The ramjet engine technology practically applies in many cases ranging from missiles, supersonic aircraft to artillery rounds, while the scramjet engines are still highly experimental.",
      "Burning occurs subsonically in the ramjet and supersonically in the scramjet. Leaving the burner, the hot exhaust passes through a nozzle, which is shaped to accelerate the flow. Because the exit velocity is greater than the free stream velocity, thrust is created as described by the general thrust equation. The flow exiting a scramjet inlet is supersonic and has fewer shock losses than a ramjet inlet at the same vehicle velocity. In the burner, a small amount of fuel is combined with the air and ignited. In a typical engine, 100 pounds of air/sec. is combined with only 2 pounds of fuel/sec.",
      "A scramjet (supersonic combusting ramjet) is a variant of a ramjet airbreathing jet engine in which combustion takes place in supersonic airflow. Space launch vehicles may or may not benefit from having a scramjet stage. A scramjet stage of a launch vehicle theoretically provides a specific impulse of 1000 to 4000 s whereas a rocket provides less than 450 s while in the atmosphere."

Eye color is the color of the iris, which can be green, blue, or brown.",
      "Well, the iris changes the size of the pupil so when you are in bright light your pupil will get smaller because the eye will absorb all light striking it. However, when you are in a dark room or place your pupil will get bigger/wider because it has no light to absorb it so your eye wants light.",

Breathing air can be generated on board by the electrolysis of water. Fresh water is generated from seawater by reverse osmosis. Answer by NeedForSpeed (16). Submarines are capable of producing air, water, and power so the only limitation for submarines is their food supply. Submarines can stay submerged until the food is depleted."

When you take away the two 30-foot-long end zones at each end, the field is 48,000 square feet, making an acre about 91% of the field.",

The two sides of a 1-acre rectangular lot can be any lengths as long as multiplying one by the other gives 43,560 (if they are measured in feet). For example, imagine a sidewalk 5 feet wide. If it were (43560 ÷ 5 =) 8712 feet long it would take up an acre, a long skinny acre. On the other hand, if the 1-acre lot were a square, its sides would be only 208.7 feet long"

You've probably heard health experts saying to shop the perimeter of a grocery store. That's because the center of the store is where most of the highly processed foods reside"

      "Most urinary tract infections occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract and start to multiply in the bladder. Women may be more prone to UTIs than men because their urethras are closer to the anus, the source of UTI-causing bacteria. Nowadays, doctors are concerned that urinary tract infections have joined the long list of bacterial infections growing resistant to antibiotics. The more frequently that bacteria are exposed to certain antibiotic, the greater the chance resistant strains will develop.",
      "How dangerous a UTI becomes depends on the overall health of the affected person and on whether or not the bacteria spread from the bladder out to other parts of the body. Many UTIs cause symptoms related to bladder irritation, such as burning with urination, blood in the urine, and sometimes fever and abdominal pain. Treating such a UTI with oral antibiotics usually results in quick improvement. A urinary tract infection (UTI) “ common in older adults -- can vary in seriousness from a minor medical problem all the way to a life-threatening illness.",
      "UTIs become much more dangerous when they spread from the bladder into the bloodstream or to the kidney.

Echinoderms are often difficult animals to kill and many have well developed powers of regeneration.

      "During their electricians training they will need to become familiar with electrical circuity theory. Luckily, electrical circuity theory is a part of most high school Physics courses. This makes taking at least one physics course during high school an excellent idea for potential electricians. The electrical industry is an exciting and rapidly expanding career that offers steady employment, excellent pay, and rewarding work. Qualified and experienced electricians are highly sought after and the need will continue to increase over the next 5-10 years as more and more tradespeople retire.",
      "I am now in secondary school an i am thinking of being an electrician and i want to know what subject do i need to become one. Update: plus i also want to know how much do they get paid a year. Report Abuse. You will need to go for a training course of whatever kind of electrician you want to be, if you want to become a fridge electrician you will need to apply for a course that teaches you that exactly.

      "Normal Microbiota are the non-pathogenic bacteria/micro-organisms that reside in or on a human body. ",
      "Recently, the more appropriate term microbiota is applied, though its use has not eclipsed the entrenched use and recognition of flora with regard to bacteria and other microorganisms. Both terms are being used in different literature. The microbiota adapts to host changes such as inflammation. Adaptation shift microbiota to a vulnerable tissue site. Genotoxin azoxymethane and colon barrier–disrupting agent dextran sodium sulfate independently result in colon tumors in susceptible mouse strains; combining them accelerates tumorigenesis.",
      "Depiction of the human body and bacteria that predominate. A microbiota is the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space. Joshua Lederberg coined the term, emphasising the importance of microorganisms inhabiting the human body in health and disease. The symbiotic relationship between animal host and microbiota has a significant impact on shaping the immune system. The immune system is able to recognize the types of bacteria that are harmful to the host and combats them, while allowing the helpful bacteria to carry out their functions."

    "documents": [
      "The determining factor as to the softness or loudness of a sound is the amplitude of the sound wave. We know that sound is mechanical energy, and a source of sound will put me … chanical energy into the medium through which it is going to travel. Let's look at the wave. Loudness is a subjective measure, which is often confused with objec … tive measures of sound prtessure such as decibels or sound intensity. Filters such as A-weighting attempt to adjust sound measurements to correspond to loudness as perceived by the average human.",
      "The term loudness could be applied to the measure of the amount of sound, and we often use the bel (commonly, the decibel) to measure sound. The decibel is actually a comparison of a sound level to another or to a standard. No better proof of the relative nature of the word loud can probably be found than that. Loudness is a subjective measure, which is often confused with objec … tive measures of sound prtessure such as decibels or sound intensity. Filters such as A-weighting attempt to adjust sound measurements to correspond to loudness as perceived by the average human.",
      "Loudness is the characteristic of a sound that is primarily a psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). A sound of constant SPL will be perceived to increase in loudness as samples of duration 20, 50, 100, 200 ms are heard, up to a duration of about 1 second at which point the perception of loudness will stabilize.",
      "The benchmark threshold of hearing, in other words the smallest perceptible amplitude, is approximately 0.00002 N/m 2 for a 1 kHz tone in laboratory conditions (this is actually contradicted by loudness curves discussed below). Power is also proportional to amplitude squared, therefore power and intensity are proportional to each other. Decibels: While power is measured in watts, the most-used acoustic measurement for intensity is the decibel (dB) .",
      "Explanation [edit]. The perception of loudness is related to both the sound pressure level (SPL) and duration of a sound. The human auditory system averages the effects of SPL over a 600–1000 ms interval. A sound of constant SPL will be perceived to increase in loudness as samples of duration 20, 50, 100, 200 ms are heard, up to a duration of about 1 second at which point the perception of loudness will stabilize."

The density of ice is 0.9167 g/cm 3 at 0 °C, whereas water has a density of 0.9998 g/cm³ at the same temperature. Liquid water is densest, essentially 1.00 g/cm³, at 4 °C and becomes less dense as the water molecules begin to form the hexagonal crystals of ice as the freezing point is reached. When ice melts, it absorbs as much energy as it would take to heat an equivalent mass of water by 80 °C. During the melting process, the temperature remains constant at 0 °C. While melting, any energy added breaks the hydrogen bonds between ice (water) molecules.",

Here we are discussing the density of water at different temperature and in different types of water like in salted water, sea water, pure water, water vapour. The density of distilled water is 1 g/cm3, 1 kg per litre, 1 tone per m3 or one gram per ml. The Density of tap water is 1 gram/cm3 and 1 gram per milliliter. It should be noted that mostly all the densities are the same.",

The specific enthalpy of fusion of water is 333.55 kJ/kg at 0 °C, i.e. melting ice absorbs the same energy as ice warming from -160 degrees Celsius up to its melting point.

The basic concept of the contingency fee agreement is that the client is out little or no upfront expenses; you as a client do not pay legal fees unless and until you win, and then the lawyer receives a percentage of your recovery as his or her fee.",
      "This means that you don’t pay money to your attorney up front. Payment to your attorney depends on, or is contingent upon, there being some recovery of settlement money or jury award in your case. The payment to your attorney is then a percentage of that settlement money or jury award.

A contingent fee (in the United States) or conditional fee (in England and Wales) is any fee for services provided where the fee is payable only if there is a favourable result. In the law, it is defined as a fee charged for a lawyer's services only if the lawsuit is successful or is favorably settled out of court.... Contingent fees are usually calculated as a percentage of the client's net recovery.. In the English legal system, it is generally referred to as no win no fee. A conditional fee agreement between a law firm and a client. The usual form of this agreement is that the solicitor will take a law case on the understanding that if lost, no payment is made. ",
      "Fees. We generally operate on a contingent fee basis, meaning we only get paid if we collect money for you. Our contingent fee is usually a fixed percentage of what is collected. The percentage charged will be determined by agreement between the client and David J. Mauer. "

The church tower was hit by enemy cannon fire and the top of the tower was blown off, making Humpty Dumpty have a great fall. Colchester was a royalist stronghold, meaning all the king’s horses and all the king’s men tried to put Humpty Dumpty back together, but due to the fact that Richard Drew didn’t create duct tape until the 1920’s, the king’s men couldn’t repair poor Humpty.",

Due to their small size, clown fish are preyed upon by a number of predators but can be difficult to catch are they often retreat into the safety of the sea anemone.

Stripping leaves off of branches and shrubs is their favorite thing to do. Goats will also eat dry leaves, shoots, weeds, grasses, and apples."

This biological process occurs in all living organisms and is the basis for biological inheritance. DNA usually exists as a double-stranded structure, with both strands coiled together to form the characteristic double-helix. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of nucleotides.

      "DNA is made up of two strands and each strand of the original DNA molecule serves as a template for the production of the complementary strand, a process referred to as semiconservative replication. Cellular proofreading and error-checking mechanisms ensure near perfect fidelity for DNA replication. DNA usually exists as a double-stranded structure, with both strands coiled together to form the characteristic double-helix. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of nucleotides. Nucleotides in DNA contain a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate, and a nucleobase.",
      "Copying occurs at a localized region called the replication fork, which is a Y shaped structure where new DNA strands are synthesised by a multi-enzyme complex. Here the DNA to be copied enters the complex from the left. One new strand is leaving at the top of frame and the other new strand is leaving at bottom. The first step in DNA replication is the separation of the two strands by an enzyme called helicase. The other half of the DNA double helix, known as the lagging strand, has the opposite 3' to 5' orientation and consequently requires a more complicated copying mechanism. As it emerges from the helicase, the lagging strand is organised into sections called Okazaki fragments."

      "When terminal segments of the tapeworm break off and pass into the cat's stool, they can be seen crawling on the surface of the feces. These proglottid segments look like grains of cooked white rice or cucumber seeds. Less commonly, segments are seen moving around the cat's anus. After treatment, the tapeworm dies and is usually digested within the intestine, so worm segments don't usually pass into the stool. Side effects, such as vomiting and diarrhea, are rarely reported with the newer tapeworm medications. Flea control is the cornerstone of preventing Dipylidium caninum infection."

You should allow five minutes cooking time for each pound, so if you have three 1-1/4-pound steaks, your timer should be set for 18 to 20 minutes, depending on how rare you want your steak to be."

Conductivity, in general, is the capacity to transmit something, such as electricity or heat. Gases are normally poor conductors because the atoms are too far apart to allow a free exchange of electrons. However, if a sample of gas contains a significant number of ions, it can act as a fair conductor. A substance that does not conduct electricity is called an insulator or dielectric material.",
      "Confidence votes 106. Conductors of electricity are materials that let electricity pass through them. A good conductor of electricity is something that allows electricity to flow smoothly. Some conductors include silver, copper, gold, aluminum, and calcium. An electrical insulator is a material that resists electric current, and will not allow it to flow easily. Examples include glass and most ceramics. An electrical conductor … is a material that offers very little resistance to electric current, allowing it to flow freely and easily."

      "Best Answer: There are two main types of smog: gray and brown. Gray smog is associated with old cities like London or New York and is produced through large-scale burning of coal and fuel. Brown smog is more characteristic of a city like L.A. and is produced by automobile exhaust."

      "Covering a few garden beds might require only a few bags of mulch. However, if you want to cover a large portion of your front or backyard, you probably should buy in bulk.

Unless you own a truck or SUV, consider having the mulch delivered to your home, which adds an extra $350 to $700 to these prices."

Submitted: 2 years ago. Category: HVAC. The ceilings on the top floor are also very high. Expert: Airheatman replied 2 years ago. Ok, as a rule of thumb you can figure about 1600 to 1800 per ton with the zone systems.So 8000 to 9000 per system. 3 systems would be in the 24,000 to 27,000 price range.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.

      "Reproduction (or procreation) is the biological process by which new individual organisms – offspring – are produced from their parents. Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: asexual and sexual. In asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to single-celled organisms. The cloning of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The evolution of sexual reproduction is a major puzzle for biologists.",
      "Asexual Reproduction in Other Organisms. Animals are not the only organisms that reproduce asexually. Yeasts, plants and bacteria are capable of asexual reproduction as well. Bacterial asexual reproduction most commonly occurs by a kind of cell division called binary fission. In asexual reproduction, one individual produces offspring that are genetically identical to itself. These offspring are produced by mitosis. There are many invertebrates, including sea stars and sea anemones for example, that produce by asexual reproduction. Common forms of asexual reproduction include:",

Because of this, a single individual organism is able to produce a nearly exact copy of itself. Fragmentation and Blackworms. Many species of annelids (worms) reproduce via an asexual process called fragmentation. Included in this category of worms are California blackworms, or mudworms. These worms are hermaphroditic -- they have both male and female reproductive parts -- and can reproduce sexually.",
      "Organisms, both prokaryotes (the archaea and the bacteria), and eukaryotes (such as protists and unicellular fungi), reproduce asexually through binary fission; most of these are also capable of sexual reproduction. Another type of fission is multiple fission that is advantageous to the plant life cycle. Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some annelid worms [Which ones?] , turbellarians and sea stars), fungi, and plants."

      "Scientists recognize four main types of volcanoes: stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, cinder cones, and ashflow calderas. Stratovolcanoes. Stratovolcanoes, or composite volcanoes, get their name from the different layers, or strata, of ash and lava that form them. Most stratovolcanoes are irregularly shaped mountains formed by material ejected from both a central vent and other vents on the sides of the mountain.",
      "A volcano is a vent or fissure in Earth's crust through which lava, ash, rock and gases erupt. A volcano is also a mountain formed by the accumulation of these eruptive products. Let's take a look at how volcanoes form: Earth's crust is 40 to 250 miles (64 to 402 kilometers) thick. Lava Plateaus: Shield volcanoes may erupt along lines of fissures rather than a central vent spilling liquid lava in successive layers. Over time as these layers form broad plateaus such as the Columbia Plateau. These plateaus are often cut by deep canyons that expose the layers of rock.",
      "Lava flow during a rift eruption at Krafla, Iceland in 1984. Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption and the resulting rock after solidification and cooling. This molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. Pillow lava is the lava structure typically formed when lava emerges from an underwater volcanic vent or subglacial volcano or a lava flow enters the ocean. However, pillow lava can also form when lava is erupted beneath thick glacial ice."

As well, the age of onset can vary considerably within a family, even though the mutation carried by family members is the same. A mutation is an error in the genetic code which causes a gene to work abnormally. People with geneticmutations can pass these onto their children.

The number of. people with sporadic MND who also have an MND-related gene mutation is not known. • In 1993 the first genetic mutation related to MND was discovered in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1). About 20% of familial MND is caused by mutations in the SOD1 gene. The remaining 90 % of people with MND are the only affected person in their family and are said to have ‘sporadic’ MND. People with familial MND have the disorder because of a mutation in a gene. A mutation is an error in the genetic code which causes a gene to work abnormally.

Tip # 2: Applying base and top coats is necessary. In doing a manicure, always apply a base coat first before applying a colored nail polish. Apply 2 coats of colored nail polish before applying a top coat. Let every coat dry before applying the next one. Be sure to do this in every fingernail and toenail. Although the quality nail polish costs more, the better result you can get. Tip # 4: Make sure nails are thoroughly clean. Free your nails from oil since it contributes in the chipping of nail polish. You can apply nail polish remover even if your nails are polish-free to get rid of natural oils on the nail surface.

It often occurs where there is no damp-proof course (DPC) or where the DPC has been damaged or bridged.",

      "Rising damp is the common term for the slow upward movement of water in the lower sections of walls and other ground-supported structures by capillary action. Although rising damp of up to 5 metres in height has been observed the height of rise is typically much lower and is rarely above 1.5m. Rising damp has been a widely observed phenomenon for at least two hundred years.",
      "The most common visual symptom of rising damp is a clearly defined band of dampness, starting from the floor upwards – often causing paint to flake or wallpaper to peel. However damp walls, caused by rising damp, can also result in a wide range of other symptoms including: 1  Damp smells or a musty odour. "

Diabetes can lead to dangerous health problems, such as having a heart attack or stroke. The good news is that there are things you can do to take control of diabetes and prevent its problems.",
      "Diabetes is a health condition that disrupts the body’s normal production of insulin. Currently, more than one million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year, and many others have the disease but are unaware of it. Without proper maintenance, diabetes can have major health complications. The onset of diabetes is dependent on a complex interplay of genetics, each individual’s immune system, the environment, and lifestyle choices. Not everyone with a bad diet will develop diabetes, and not everyone with a healthy diet will avoid it.",
      "Best Answer: Type 1 diabetes usually strikes children because the pancreas fails to produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that takes glucose (sugar) from the blood and into the cells. This is how our body has energy for life and it's functions. Type 2 diabetes use to be called adult onset because it use to happen mostly to overweight adults. There is no cure for type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes can go into remission after weight loss, gastric bypass or banding. Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder linked to obesity, it develops over time, with the body becoming progressively less able to control blood sugar levels. Some patients, who have had ‘gastric banding’, show a reversal of diabete",
      "In type 1 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in childhood, a person’s pancreas fails to produce insulin from birth. Therefore, the body does not convert glucose into sugar, which is essential for cell function. What you eat plays a huge role in your health. The onset of diabetes is dependent on a complex interplay of genetics, each individual’s immune system, the environment, and lifestyle choices. Not everyone with a bad diet will develop diabetes, and not everyone with a healthy diet will avoid it."
