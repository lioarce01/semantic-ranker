      "Transformer models excel at capturing long-range dependencies in text through self-attention mechanisms. They process entire sequences in parallel rather than sequentially.",
      "RNNs and LSTMs were the previous state-of-the-art for NLP tasks, but transformers have largely replaced them due to better parallelization and performance.",
      "Transformers use multi-head attention to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously, allowing for better understanding of context.",
      "The main advantage of transformers is their ability to handle variable-length sequences efficiently without the vanishing gradient problem."
